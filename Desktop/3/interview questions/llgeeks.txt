Merge Sort for Linked Lists
11 Comments | Filed under Linked Lists June 6, 2010
Merge sort is often preferred for sorting a linked list. The slow random-access performance of a linked list makes some other algorithms (such as quicksort) perform poorly, and others (such as heapsort) completely impossible.

Alternating split of a given Singly Linked List
15 Comments | Filed under Linked Lists May 23, 2010
Write a function AlternatingSplit() that takes one list and divides up its nodes to make two smaller lists ‘a’ and ‘b’. The sublists should be made from alternating elements in the original list. So if the original list is 0->1->0->1->0->1 then one sublist should be 0->0->0 and the other should be 1->1->1.

Delete alternate nodes of a Linked List
8 Comments | Filed under Linked Lists May 20, 2010
Given a Singly Linked List, starting from the second node delete all alternate nodes of it. For example, if the given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then your function should convert it to 1->3->5, and if the given linked list is 1->2->3->4 then convert it to 1->3.

Pairwise swap elements of a given linked list
10 Comments | Filed under Linked Lists April 29, 2010
Given a singly linked list, write a function to swap elements pairwise. For example, if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then the function should change it to 2->1->4->3->5, and if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then the function should change it to 2->1->4->3->6->5.
