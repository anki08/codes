There were two papers one was aptitude ( 36 questions) and other was 
technical(20 questions)

1: given an expression tree and asked us to write the in fix of that expression

four choices


2:
  global variables in different files are

a:at compiletime
b) loading time
c) linking time
d)execution time

3)size of(int)
a) always 2 bytes
b) depends on compiler that is being used
c) always 32 bits
d) can't tell

4)which one will over flow given two programs
2
prog 1:                                 prog2:

main()                                  main()
{                                       {
int fact;                                       int fact=0
long int x;                             for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
fact=factoral(x);                               fact=fact*i;

}                                       }


int factorial(long int x)
{

if(x>1) return(x*factorial(x-1);
}

a) program 1;
b) program 2;
c) both 1 &2
d) none

}

5) variables of fuction call ar
