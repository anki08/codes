Subject: [CHETANA] (Freshers) Hexaware campus pattern


Dear Friends,
Hexaware came to our campus this week. The pattern was a bit  different from wat we had got from freshersworld but few questions got repeated (17). The questions were all easy to answer but time was a major constrain. 

No of Questions : 100
Time : 60 Minutes
No negaive markings

After written test, we had GD and after that interview is shedueled on coming tuesday.

We were supppose to chose the topic for the GD. They select 1/5 in written test and 2/5 in GD.

The questions were from a wide spectrum like english, basic mathematics, solving algorithms, general computer awareness etc.

The english part consisted of Synonyms, antonyms, fill in the blanks, finding the mis-spelt word (there were 5 in each.)

Computer awarness had ques from basic computer knowledge

Solving Algos : A simple program was given and the output was asked for different values of inputs.
 I dont remember the exact ques. I am just giving a sample, which  is similar to the one given there.
 S= 0; C = 0
 Read A,B
 While ((2A+3B) < 100)
 {
 S = 3A - 2B
 c = c + 1
 }
 Print a,s,c
 Following this there were 5 quetions. every ques carried 1 mark.
 Wat is the output if a = 26 b = 12
 wat is the output if a = 24 b = 16 etc..


In Mathematics some ques were simple and others were a bit time consuming.
 |X| + X = 0 wat is the value of X
a) 1      b) 0        c) 1,0      d) None of these

 If 38473ABC(This was not the exact no given) is divisible by 75 what is ABC in the same order

 x + 1/x = 2 x^100 + 1/x^100
 f(z) = 1/1-x find f(f(f(1/x)))



The following questions got repeated from the pattern found in www.freshersworld.com

In the series 0, 3, 8, 15,__ What is the next number?
Ans :  24

finish the work.

than B. Then what is the share amount of B in a profit of Rs.886 ?
Ans: Rs. 265.8

Wat I felt with this test was it was better to go thro all the 100 ques, cos some easy ones were there at the last. If U think U can certainly solve a problem but its time consuming just leave it and proceed to the next one. Some of the ques were very easy, even U no need to use pen and paper. 

ALL THE BEST TO THOSE APPEARING FOR THE WRITTEN TEST.
With Wishes 
Sanjeev

u were asking abt hexaware pattern and questions na,

pattern - 100 qns in 60 mins

Verbal

Find the Wrongly Spelt word

Synonym

Antonym

Fill in the blanks

Aptitude (purely mathematical)

- Better have a look at the previous 1998 qn paper, from that we got many questions.

- strong analytical geometric and mensurational skills needed.

Computer Awareness

- Simply like find odd man out and 10 qns regarding 2 pseudocodes given



Time Constraint was the big thing, u cannot complete the paper if u solve all the qns, its not needed also, they're just seeing the relative mark, in our college from 150 , 29 were shortlisted for GD and from it 12 were shortlisted for Interview, i missed out in GD.

Topics were War on Iraq, Leaders Born or Made



Try to assess ur group in GD, if u think its of to be an debating group, pls don't follow GD rules, and create ur oppurtunities for speaking as raising ur tone, intervening the conversation going on, 'its pretty sure that u'll be going off the GD rules, but it was the case in our group", i followed GD rules and i missed it out.

Walk/Swim thro Coding

40. Input a,b
    s=0;
    c=a;
    d=b;
    while(d<>0)
    {
     s=s+c;
     d=d-1;
    }
    Print s

    for given values of a,b find the output
    5questions for different values of a,b 

41. Input a,b
    while(3a+2b<100)
    {
      s=s+a;
      a=a+2;
      b=b-1;
    }

      for given values of a,b (i remember one 29,5) find the output
        

Tips
1. Do the coding first and you are out - They are time consuming - Save the worst for last 
 
2. Be choosy - take the easy (questions) first - So scan scan scan 
 
3. best path in hexaware tree
    language ----> 
         odd man out ----> 
               computer awareness ----> 
                        easy sums ----->
                              difficult sums---->
                                          coding
 
 do this or find the path to your home. 
 

4.SPEED kills but also wins. Put your brain in 5th gear 
 
5.Blind goose guess - mark a or e - they are more probable 
 
6. Write your q paper code proper or your are a man overboard 
 
7. There is minimum  no of q to be attempted(so they didnt say explicitly) and no negative marking. So be generous!waste your ink! cross off for all questions 
 
8. They will ask u in the pep talk in GD waht is the first or last question or your code. 
   So watch out all those DANGER-PAST-QUESTIONS-FORGOT type fellows


Group Discussion
1. No GD only shout!!! - Our LOk Sabha Style
2. Shout at top of your voice and shout some meaningful points
3. Please train ur vocal chords! Drink our good pure(pun intended) water before GD
4. IF u cant then carry a loudspeaker
5. 10 per group max 3 groups
6. final interview they select 3 from each group
7. Dont think 1-proposer 1-opposer 1-moderator it could 3-proposer or 3 opposer too.
8. If your group is silent Please follow GD rules.
9. 30 minutes of shouting(3min-choose the topic, 2min-prepare,20min-shout)
10. They might also give you  a topic.
11. Please dont wait for your chance - Grab it
12. Be ready to summarise. Try to say all the points told and say conclusion is yet to be reached.
13. 2 or 3 choosen people will summarise.
14. Dont ever make unruly gestures. You are out immediately.
15. Be ready for any topic.Only general topic - no subject,economics style



*****************************************

1. If you like my effort post ur thanx in the group  Encouragement energises me.

2. Update this questions and post it as Haxaware testv2.0
