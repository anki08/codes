Subject: [CHETANA] (JOB) I got through HEXAWARE


Hi to all............
This is my first mail to this group. And I have joined the group a week back. And I have a got a job in Hexaware technologies. 
Friends, I would like to share this. There was an open test conducted on 11th Oct. 2003. I cleared the paper and after that on the same day we had GD of the selected candidates. Next there was a PI on the Next day. And they said they r going to inform teh selected candidates by mail or Tel. After 2 months of wait I finally got call for the offer letter. So its better late than never.
The questions in PI were mainly concerned with the overview of the technical knowledge. Like explain polymorphism, why do we use Normalization, the various development models etc. 
So friends I would like to thanks all the  group members, may be there was something or some sort of encouragement I got from this group, which ultimately turned my fortunes.
Btw All the best to rest of you and have patience as it is this which secures tthe seam of victory.
Yours Friend
Tushar
