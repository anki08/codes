Subject: [CHETANA] (JOB) I got thru HEXAWARE !!!



Hello Friends,

I got into Hexaware Technologies!!!!! And I thank each member of the Chetana family for their untiring efforts to help freshers like me. I had applied to hexaware long back thru the id that was already posted in the groups. I got a call to attend the test on Nov 29th. The test and GD took place on the same day at a school in T.Nagar. The tech interview was scheduled on 1st Dec. I got the offer letter on 3rd Dec asking me to join on 4th. I have finally got thru and now in training at GN Chetty rd. Hexaware tower.

The test was completely aptitude, unlike the papers posted in freshersworld. But it was easy. Time was the main factor. 100 questions in 60 min. The main idea is to attend and mark answers which you are sure about. I answered around 70 and was confident in what i marked.
The GD was general and the tech interview varied with panels.

For friends who are still looking for a job, All the very best.
All of us do settle, but it takes time. Thats all. Be patient - there is a place for every one of us.

All the best
Regards
Manjusha.M
