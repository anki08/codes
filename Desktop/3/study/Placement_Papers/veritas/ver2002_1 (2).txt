II section
----------
THIS QUESTION WAS THERE IN OUR WRITTEN;
1) f(0) <= f(1) <= f(2) <= ...
   g(0) <= g(1) <= g(2) <= ...
   h(0) <= h(1) <= h(2) <= ...

  That is given three monotonically non-decreasing functions asked us to give 
algorithm to find the smallest common value such that 

  f(i) = g(j) = h(k) for some i, j, k

 
2) Given an array consisting of both +ve and -ve numbers ... give a O(n) 
algorithm to find the max subsequence sum (standard problem see Allen Weise
book)


EVEN THIS WAS  THER :)
3) Given a hetrogeneous circular doubly linked list with the following 
node definitions

   struct A {
     char data1;
     int  data2;
     void *ll_prev;
     void *ll_next;
     int  thisdata;
   };

   struct B {
     int data1;
     chat data2;
     int data3;
     void *ll_prev;
     void *ll_next;
     int thisdata;
     char data4;
   };

Each node 'thisdata' field which denotes whether it's ll_prev and ll_next 
point to type A or Type B node ...

   thisdata = 1  -- Type A node
   thisdata = 2  -- Type B node

Your given a pointer to the first node of the list ... the first node 
is of type A.  Give an algorithm to add a Type B node 


4) Consider the following function

   int X = 0;

   void somefunc(int p, int q) {
      int i;

      for(i=p; i<q; ++i) {
         somefunc(i+1, q);
         ++X;
      }
   }

If q>p always ... give a formula/expression to determine the no.of times
variable X is incremented in terms of p and q.


THIS WAS THE PUZZLE IN OUR PAPER, NOT THER IN PREV PAPER;
5)  A man is usually picked up from the rail station by his driver at
17:00hrs, who(driver) reaches the station driving from home at the same time.
Then the driver drives the man back home. it so happens one day that the
man arrives one hour earlier than expected at the rail station and instead of
waiting for his driver decides to walk back home. Some way thru
he comes across his car and drives back to his house in car. He finds that
he reached home 10 minutes earlier. So now how long did the man walk??
