1.Can there be virtual constructors/distructors? why would one use it?

2. Can constructors/distructors be overriddent? why would one do that?

3. compare LFU vs. LRU.. what are the overheads, anomalies, if any.

4. What is thrashing? how would you try to ensure that system does not 
thrash?

5. What is a clustered file system? what r the issues therein?

6. How do you ensure ACID properties in a Distributed Real time 
environment? don't take any assumptions regarding reliability of the 
any component in the system.

7. Explain IPC and various mechanisms for implementing IPC.

8. How do you pass a file descriptor from a parent process to a child 
process?

9. Can a child process use file descriptor of a file opened by the 
parent, if it passes it?

10. If you are required to find all palindromes from the english 
dictionary, what kind of data structures and algorithms would you choose?

11. How do you keep backups efficiently on say twice per day basis? 
Backups being expensive can we come up with some tricky thing which can 
elimiate copying the entire thing to one or more disks?

12. something abt a project you have done..

13. General questions on background, why do you want to join Veritas, 
etc..

Architecture  :

   Whats the effect of increasing pipeline length ...
 
   Inverted page table ... describe ... 

   Do u always flush TLB on context switch 

   When do u flush TLBs other than context switch     

   ( few other questions on paging ) 

  

Compilers 

    What optimizations can u think od doing on pointer manipulatioj in a
strongly typed language like C . 

    Explain 'aliasing'      

    ( some simple compiler optimization questions ) 
          
Algorithms 

    Given an unordered array and a sum S , how can u find efficiently
whether there are two elkements in the array which add to S.   

    Sorting .. complexity ( space and time ) ...  why quick sort is
preferred to merge sort  .. etc  
OS 
     Whats a semaphore 

     Whats the difference bewteeb a mutex and a semaphore  
      
     ( some more questions on synchronization ) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.what r the design issues when developing a os for multiprocessor systems
2.how are locks (in fact semophores implemented ) particularly for 
multiprocessor systems.
3.given a file which is constantly being appended by few writer user 
processes and read by large number of reader processes,how do u 
efficiently ensure that no reader reads a partly written content by a 
writer (ie once a writer starts writing ,either the reader should be shown 
what was there before the writer writes or should be shown after the 
writes entire content )
4. how does one determine the size of a structure without using sizeof 
operator.
5.The most ultimate question ever -write a C program to find the nth 
fibonacci number .
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
os
--
1. fundas about different sized pages in memory management
2. segmentation against paging
3. mutual exclusion
4. implementation of semaphore using TSL and swap instructions 
5. deadlocks


networks
--------
1. bridges v/s routers
2. how to simulate a duplex connection given a simplex connection
3. effect of packet size on communication with respect to error etc..
