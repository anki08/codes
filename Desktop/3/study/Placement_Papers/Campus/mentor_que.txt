Hi Ashwin,
    If mentor graphics has not visited out campus yet, this year, you may find 
the following list useful. These are some of the questions that I faced at a 
recent interview at mentor graphics.

1). virtual function in C++
2). friend functions
3). the sequence in which constructors of classes A, B and C are called when
class A is inherited from class B which is inherited from class C.
4). semaphores and mutexes.
5) what is that we can't do with boolean variables that can be done with
semaphores.
6). differences between/advantages and disadvantages of #define and inline
functions.

>>> Macro (# define) are a fraction of nano second faster but the disadv. of using macros
is difficulty in debugging program. The code is literally copied wherever macros are refered. 
so if user passes 'double' instead of 'int', there could be problem in execution. where as using inline function 
in this case compiler will give error. Note to C++ programmers: When declaring and defining a function within a class,
the function is automatically inlined so there is no need for the extra inline request.

7). steps in the compilation of a C program. or steps in preprocessing in sequence.

8). question about UNIX file system.
9). inode number 0 corresponds to what.

10). name few compiler optimizations (little more about compiler optimizations
11). differences between typedef and #define
12). differences between a reference and a pointer in C++.
13). what is LALR parser.
14). A question on unions: If we have a union with three variables int i,
char c, float f; and we store a value in say the variable c now. and we
forget what is the variable of the union that holds a value currently, after
some time. for this is there any mechanism provided by the language using
which we can find out whether it is i or c or f that currently holds a
value.

x, char c}; and the com   If mentor graphics has not visited out campus yet, this year, you may find

which we can find out whether it is i or c or f that currently holds a
value.
15). padding bytes for structures: suppose there is structure struct x{ int
x, char c}; and the compiler is a four byte compiler. then what is memory
allocated to variable of this struct type. if the structure definition is
struct y{char x; int y;}; then what is the memory allocated for a variable
of this type.
16). prototype definition of the printf() function.
17). how do you dynamically allocate a two dimensional array of size a by b.
ans: int **x;
x = (int**)malloc(sizeof(int*)*a);
for(int i=0;i<a;i++)
   x[i] = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*b);
Q:then what if it is assigned as: int *y = (int*)x;
18). differences between 'extern' and 'static'
19) question on declarations of function pointers in C(it seems that mentor
graphics people will ask this question everybody)
20). differences between Java and C++.
21). inorder, preorder, and post order traversals.
22). how do you find out if a loop(cycle) exists in a linked list,
efficiently.
23) name the oo concepts.
24) 
-----------
Artificial Intelligence
1). what is hill climbing?
2). what is simulated annealing?
----------
Computer Networks
1). what is piggybacking?
2). tell some differences between congestion control and flow control?
--------
Theory of computations
1) about various complexity classes;
2). NP-hard  and NP-copmleteness,
examples;
3). what is universal Turing machine?
-------
puzzle type:
1). suppose there is a big rectangle. and suppose that a small rectangular
area is cut from the big rectangle, somewhere inside it, the sides of the
spiler is a four byte compiler. then what is memory
allocated to variable of this struct type. if the structure definition is
struct y{char x; int y;}; then what is the memory allocated for a variable
of this type.

area is cut from the big rectangle, somewhere inside it, the sides of the
smaller rectangle being parallel to the sides of the big rectangle. Now,
draw a sinlge straight line so that the area of the remaining rectangle is
divided in to exactly two halves.
