1. Draw memory model of C pgm,

	I drew the following model:

                 ---------------
                |    BSS        |
                |               |
                 ---------------
                |               |
                |   Heap        |
                 ---------------
                |               |
                |    Stack      |
                 ---------------

	I explained about them. i.e., in BSS, Global and static variables are stored. In Heap, dynamically allocated memory are stored. In Stack local variables are stored.
In BSS all the values are initialized to zero.

        Question : So where code is stored?
	Answer   : this is model of data segment, and code will be stored seperately in code segment. 


2. Why are they initializing all the values to zero? any special significance?

	initializing local(stack) won't be ,much useful, b'coz anyway when there is a function call, return address will be stored. so they are not initializing to zero. 

Question: So how will initializing global variables to stack will help?
		

3. Where are environment variables stored?
	its in BSS (then only all programs can acess it)

4. Where are command-line arguments stored?
	In stack. B'coz there are also arguments to the function.

5. How will you calculate size of a structure?

                I took an example and explained.

                struct abc
                {
                        char a; //8 bits
                        int b;  //16 bits
                        float c; //32 bits
                };

                so totally 56 bits

		They gave another example, where char will take only one bit. i.e.,
                struct abc
                {
                        char a1:1;      //1 bit
                        char 21:1;      //1 bit
                        int b;          //16 bit
                        float c;        //32 bit
                };

	So totally 50 bit. It'll be rounded to nearest byte. so It's 56 bits or 7 byte.

6. How much do you rate yourself in c++ skills?
7. What's inline fuction?
	Question: Does compiler always substitue inline fuction during compilation?
	Answer  : No, its optional!

8. On which OS do you work?
	windows, and linux. They asked which version of Linux, i
told 8 and 9.

9. They asked about my projects...
	As my UG project is related with FAT, all questions are from that.

	* What's the difference between Windows and Linux
	* The other person in the pannel asked, so do you mean, no one has attacked Linux?
	
10. Do you know multi threading? Explain me what is a process and what is a thread.

        * Then Do you mean thread is not running in the processor?
        * They gave one example...
                If you open different applications in windows like MS Word,
Outlook express, Are the diffrent threads or diffrent process?

                        They are diffrent process.

        * If you open two documents in MS word, are they threads or process
                They are child process.

        * Why?
                B'coz, even if the parent is closed, this can work seperately.

        * Ok, leave, parent child thread model. In normal case what will happen? i.e., If I close parent, what will happen to the child?


11. I want only one thread to run at a time. i.e., when one is running other shouldn't run. what will you do?
	I'll use semaphores.

12. What is semaphore?
	P and V can be used for wait and signal.

13. They asked about my MTP and course projects..
