Hi Ra,

 Really Mentor is the Third company for me.
 I have attended the Oracle interview and Went to written test of 
Mentor.

 Really the written test of Mentor very goooooood and Really people 
have
the fundamentals in Subjects can write the Exam.

 They will ask
   General S/w
   OS, Micro processor & Comp Arch, C and C++ ( very fundoo )
   Compilers


 Really Test is like GATE ra... touched every aspect of it..

 They will prefer the telugu people usually...
 
 About interview they will coool and one panel with three people..
 Two technical people and one HR ( so three people )

 They have asked me:
 1. Grade ur knowledge in c and c++ from 0 to 100
     i said 90 and 75
 3. They have asked me question in c++

    what is virtuval distrcuctor.
    Are there any default concstructors in c++? what are they?
    what is the difference between copy constructor and Overkloading 
=.
        why language is provided two of these..
    what are inline functions, what is  the difference between 
#define and
inline
   what is the difference between inline and normal function. will the
comiler take inline functions always inline ,if not on which basis it 
will
decide to ignore inline.
   
  They asked me ask one Question in C, which should be difficult to 
answer
and they shouldn't asnwer for that.
  i asked them prog which illustrates difference between extern and 
static 
  and self repricating programs.

 they asked me what is the light weight process ? i said thread and 
they
asked me what is fiber? i said i don't know.

 why ur CPI is less? why didn't you join ECE even though you get it 
after
inter ?

 what are ur strengths?
 why should we take you?
 what do u know about mentor?
 what is ur weekness?

 then the discussion in gone my projects and my thesis.

they asked me one puzzle:
 
  There are 100 gates with doors ( 1.... 100).Intially they are open.
  switching the gates ( if open then close , if closed then open ) 
can be
done. First they will switch the multiples of 1's then they will 
switch
the multiple's of 2's and soooo on multiple's of 100's.

  Now, at the end how many doors are closed and what are they?

 First i said the wrong answer ,some relevant what- the primes are 
opened.
 I said it correctly ( 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100).

 
 Then they asked me about family, and my background..

 That's it ra... 

 In TEST i didn't really , remember the questions they have asked 
ra...
 because they are long questions and multiple choices 

  C and C++:
    type checking quetions
  OS:
   why thread is lightweight 
   what is the best Scheduling algo that will give best throuh put
  Analytical:

   Good  and very intersting to solve..

   1 10 58 ____  Ans: 3^n+7^n --> 3^3+7^3

  If i can remember they i will send you...


ALL THE BEST.. That's all about the my fight with Mentor.....

Be confident on Compilers, OS and Computer Archi and C,C++.

Try to explain them , what ever you have done,

They will see the ur enthusium, how u r trying to explain ( use some 
paper
).

ALL THE BEST ra  Krishna... GOOD LUCK..

Bye
Uppala Babu
