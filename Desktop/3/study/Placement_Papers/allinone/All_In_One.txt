STM came for both IC design and embedded system
groups. The paper for embedded systems group is
already posted.

TI came to iitm only for Analog jobs..though they
allowed CSE ppl also to the test, they didnt take any.
The written test consisted of 3 sections. We have to
answer any two. One on analog design, two on digital
design and third on Data structures and algos. As i am
from CSE, i can tell u only Data Structure and Algo
questions.

1) Some OS related question..what signal to caputure
Ctrl+C in some application.
Ans: SIGINT not SIGKILL

2) Some code for transposing a matrix is given..we
have to answer what it does.

3) One tree is given. Write the topological sort
output.

4) Some code with ANDing operation and right shift.
The ans is it prints the binary equivalent of the
number.

5) Inorder traversal on binary search tree gives what?
ans: the sorted order as the output.

There are 5 more and all are very simple. To my
knowledge, the above questions are the only toughest.

Next was an aptitude test. All the questions are very
easy but time consuming..I remember a little about it
since i didnt write it seriously.

Good luck.
The pay for STM was 4.35 Gross and 5L CTC.
For TI, some 4.5 Gross.

 I am frm IIT Bombay . In IITb no test was taken for M.tech and DDs B.tech had a test. Around 40 ppls weree shortlisted from Mtech dds, there were 5 panels each panel had a pesron from different grps in Intel like testing , designing ect. Mine was testing panel I was asked simple questions as below. Other panel disscused MTech projects, or areas of working of that panel.
q1 intel which gruop u would like to join and why
ans manfact and automation grp. coz i have bacgnd in inst and automation
q1 which other grp (as he is frm testing validation gr.)
I told testing .
q2  Asked me do I know VLSi design I told little bit gave cmos dig for 
and asked me to find exp (AB+C)'.
q3 asked me do I know bollean algerbra,switchong theory ?  gave me exp a=b
exor c athen what is (a exor b exor c)
q4 which courses related with sys des I have taken?
q5 what are embeded sys?
q6 what is comp architechture
ans blk dig of comp ie cpu mem etc. and explained it.
q7 about project like what motivation for VlBR coding? what lang and  and
whow real time  DSp implementation will be done ect.
q8 What do you know about spice ? how does a spice pgm looks like? Whay it
is used? What is significance of spice library file say 18 micron tech
file ?
anms I told abt spice pgms sign. Purpose dev and ckt simulation. of
library files I said Dont know?
Q9 What kind of job are you interested wether u would like to design H/W
or software?
Ans I told him I would like to do Firmware dev. ie s/w for some dedicated
h/w. like pgmimng ctrllers, dsps ect.
q10what do you think a  testing job means I told him it may involve FPGA 
implementation and testing of ckts .
Q11 Do you have any que
Ans yes what kind of work is done in testing and validation gr he told
basicaly they simulate the variuos designed ckts using s/w like spice ect.


Finally  he told me that his gr doesnt work in area in which I am
interested but threre are other grps which do so he'll pass my info to
them.  Interview lasted for about 30 mins

Hi friends,
I got slected for STM(embedded software design
division).
I should say thanx to all the members of this group
and modarator for ur nice help.

Here is the pattern:

First of all they put cut of as 8.0(cgpa).
There were two tests, one for IC Design another for
Embedded software design. My specilasation here is
communications that's why I wrote test in Embedded
software section.

Test duration was one hour.
There were three(A,B,C) sections.
Section A contained 11 questions.
Among those 11 few questions were on C.
All C questions were standard question which generally
appear in all placement papers.
Two questions were on aptitude.
those were also very easy...

Section B:
It contained 13 Q's
It contained questions basically from comupter science
engg.
few questions on OS, few on computer architecture, one
on java few on microprocessor.

Section C:
It contained 13 Q's
Most of the questions in this section were from
communication engg, based on sampling, bitrate, BW,
SNR etc...
few questions were also there on A/D and D/A
converters.

All three sections are compulsary.
They gave one very good option here. U have choose a
section among B and C, sothat marks obtained in that
section will be doubled. Be careful there is negative
marking...

It is all about the paper.

so guys...
Prepare well and attempt confidently that will bring u
success.

Wish u all godd luck.
