                       Part  Two
          One Big Question   ( 20 Marks )

             You can answer it in C or C++.
          Better to answer in C++ itself.

###############################################################


I)   Write A programme On

     Two Schhols Are There and In Each School Some Classes
     Are There. And The Data Of Schools (students)Like This.

     1A 25 1B 35  1C 23 2A 27 2B 15 3A 25 ...  $

     1A 20 1B 23 2A 25 2B 39 .... $

     Each School Data Ends With   $ ( I/P ends when $ entered)
     In the above  1A 25 means
     1 -- First Class
     A -- Section
     25 -- Strength Of That.

    We Want To Merge To Schools And Form one School.
    Write A programme Which Takes TWo Schools Data and
    Gives The Similar Format O/P of 3rd School Which
    is The Combining Of Both Schools.

    The ProGramme Is Must be USING  Dynamic Structures ?

    ProGram Should Be Reading The DATA of TWO Schools And
    Give The FINAL O/P In SAme Format Of I/P ?
