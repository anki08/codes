hi all,

i appeared for the Hughes Gurgaon test abt 3 weeks back.
the paper consisted of 2 parts

1st was aptitude consisting of 20 ques which are damn easy but do only 15-16 ques frm them coz thr is an upper cutoff too.

2nd section had two options 
1.) Computers
2.) Electronics
u hav to give only one of thm irrespective of the branch of ur qualification.
i.e. if u r CS grad u can attempt electonics paper too n vice versa.
both the sections had 30 ques tho abt 15 are common in both.

Networking ques are a bit difficult IPv6 stuff n i thnk DHCP too . get an overview of all networking basic fundas...

there r some c ques. too n for cs grad thr r binary tree ques. n for ECE grad thr are some Communi. ques.

thts all i can remeber.
best of luck...
byeee
sunil (sunny)
