Iam really sorry for responding so late.
I wanted to sit with your work but I could not ( because of some problems )
I remember very little about the Dharma test pattern.
There was an Apptitude test. Quantitative and Analytical.
The Quantitative is very easy. You should prepare from GRE or any  CAT
Material.
The Analytical part is mostly from Barrons Guide. I remember two questions .
they are from Barron's guide. It is something about a village called "kaya-kaya
" where half the people speak truth and half lies. There was one more about set
of houses of itallian,germans,romman etc in a row whose chimmney colours were
given, their favoritr drinks were given. I hope you will find these questions
in Barron's guide. I did not get a Barron's guide to search them for you. The
interview was mostly about C , C++ . They are mostly working on C++. That will
help if you know. They are working on their own SQL. You should brush up your
fundas in DBMS. In interview there are questions in UNIX Internals also. Hope
this info is of some use to you. Good Luck. Keep me informed on the proceedings
of the campus.

                  VSAT Overview

                  Why Use VSATs?

                  VSAT networks provide rapid, reliable satellite 
transmission of data, voice, and video to an unlimited number of geographically dispersed
                  sites or from these sites to headquarters.

                  What Equipment Do I Need for My VSAT Network?

                  Each site is equipped with a VSAT terminal consisting 
of an antenna, outdoor electronics mounted on the antenna for signal
                  reception/transmission, and indoor electronics 
for connection to customer computer, telephone, and video equipment.

                             Hughes Shared Hub Services
                             Cost-effective real-time communications 
across town, or across the country.

                             Shared hub services from Hughes Network 
Systems: Making Satellite Technology work for your business.

                             Today, businesses in a wide variety 
of industries are relying on VSAT (very small aperture terminal) 
satellite networks to help them
                             communicate with their remote locations 
no matter where they are  across town, or across the country.

                             Even for businesses with relatively 
small numbers of remote sites, satellite networks can be one of the most
                             cost-effective ways to obtain efficient, on-line communications.

                             The central  the heart of your network.

                             VSAT networks rely on a central hub 
station to serve as the transfer point between the remote locations, the
                             satellite, and company headquarters 
or data center. The hub contains the necessary uplink/downlink equipment to
                             transmit signals to and from the satellite.

                             For many companies, it is not desirable 
or feasible to own and operate their own dedicated hub. The solution: shared hub services from
                             Hughes.Shared Hub Services from Hughes 
give you the efficiency of on-line communications at a cost that agrees with your bottom
                             line.

                             Hughes Network Systems owns and operates 
four full-service satellite hubs located across the country. The hubs operate seven days a
                             week, 24 hours a day. For a reasonable 
monthly fee, you have all the advantages of on-line satellite communications:

                                 Data transmission 
                                 Real-time video 
                                 Audio transmission 
                                 Disaster recovery 
                                 Pilot programs for new networks or applications 

                             Using shared hub services means you 
avoid the expense of building your own hub and maintaining a technical
                             staff to run it. You contract for only 
the amount of satellite bandwidth that you need on satellites built by the
                             world's largest satellite manufacturer. 
And when your network needs to grow or change, you can count on
                             Hughes to reconfigure the network quickly with a minimum of expense.

                             Disaster recovery: being ready for the unexpected.

                             No one likes to think that a disaster 
 either natural or  could hit the network. But in the event of a hub
                             failure, whether it's a shared hub 
or a hub dedicated to one company's operation, Hughes is ready to put you back
                             in business.

                             The Germantown hub provides complete 
backup service in the event of disaster. Hughes can bring your network
                             back up rapidly and will keep it operating 
while hub repairs are underway. As soon as the hub is repaired, we
                             switch you back to normal operation.

                             Let us show you how Hughes Shared Hub 
Services can help you advance the way your business communicates.

 Regarding Hughes
paper they conducted two tests. Both were technical(no aptitude test). 
First one was compulsory for everybody. In second one could opt for
electronics or computers. In all i suppose there were 50 questions.
I sent a request to my classmates to send me questions whatevery they
could recall. Till now only one person has responded. I am sending those
questions to you.

And just before interview you were supposed to fill up a performa which
they call Behavioural Test. This was to check you interpersonal skills and
socialising capabilities.  Questions like - would you like to be elected
leaders of organising committees, do you like peoply express their agonies
to you, do you wish people be close to you type questions were repeated in
one and the other form.

Interview was technical as well as personal. CGPA did count - it seems.
They selected 8 people from here. BTW what's your current CGPA and what's
the strength of your class. Do they come for B.Tech and M.Tech separatel
as the case here is or it's all at once.

Questions :
 
1.If a precondition of a sub routine fails then
  a. post condition fails as well
  b. Post condition may fail
  c. post condition is declared but now defined.

2. whatz the o/p of the following program
   
 char * a= "AabbCc";
 void x(char *a)
 {  
   a[0] == 0 ? x(a+1):1;
   printf("%c",*a);
   return 1;

Top 10 Interview Tips OF Hughes:
================================

Here are the 10 most commonly asked questions in the job interview, which will
help you prepare yourself better for the forthcoming campus placement and also
give you a competitive edge over others. 

A well thought out answer to these questions, prepared and rehearsed in
advance with the logical sequencing of the events will help you sail through.

                   1. Tell us about yourself

This is an open canvas for you giving you an opportunity to direct and lead
your interview in the direction you want. Good idea will be to structure your
answer in the following three broad heads:
Family Background
                       Educational Background (starting from schooling to
                       professional qualifications) 
                       Achievements

In all the above subheads speak only that information which will give strength
to your candidature. Avoid verbose description of yourself. 

                   2. Why do you want to join us? 

To answer this question, you must have researched the company well. Here you
can quote some of your personal beliefs, which are in conjunction with the
values of the company or talk about specific products and services which could
be your professional interest too.

In the event where your skill set is mapping with the requirement of the
company, do not miss the chance to highlight the same. Specify the initiatives
taken or work done to attain that skill set. 

3. What would you like to be doing five years from now? 

This question is asked to assess candidates career plan and ambition for
growth and to see if the company will be able to provide that opportunity over
period of time. Also to assess if your personal goals are not totally off
tangent with what companys objectives are. It is also to check your stability
with the organization. It is good idea to be very realistic in your answer. If
need be take guidance from your seniors who are already in the corporate
environment. 

                   4. Do you prefer working with others or alone? 

This question is usually asked to determine whether you are a team player.
Before answering, however, be sure you know whether the job requires you to
work alone. Then answer appropriately. 

                   5. What are your biggest accomplishments

You may like to begin your reply with: "Although I feel my biggest
achievements are still ahead of me, I am proud of my involvement withI made my
contribution as part of that team and learnt a lot in the process".  It will
be a good idea to close your answer with also specifying what attributes and
circumstances made you succeed. 

                   6. What are your favorite subjects

 It is a leading question giving direction to the panel members for possible
areas where they can probe in further for your knowledge base and in depth
understanding. It is advisable to select the topics that you are competent in.

                   7. Why should we hire you? 

Keep your answer short and to the point. You should highlight areas from your
background that relates to the need of the organization. Recap the
organizations description of the job, meeting it point by point with your
skills.

                   8. What are your hobbies? 

This question is generally asked to assess whether you are "desktop" kind of a
person or an "interaction orientated person". It also indicates your
preference for team - oriented activities or projects with solo contributions. 
It enables the organization to place you accordingly after selection. Be
candid with your answer.

                   9. What is the worst feedback you have ever got? 

To answer this question you must admit and share your areas of improvement.
Also sharing an action plan for improving oneself will indicate your ability
to take criticism well. Your answer should be reflection of your
open-mindedness.

                   10. What is the most difficult situation you have faced? 

Here you should be ready with the real life story. The question looks for
information on two fronts: How do you define difficult? and, what was your
handling of the situation? You should be able to clearly lay down the road map
for solving the problem, your ability to do task management and maintain good
interaction with your team members and other peers. It is advisable to close
with highlighting the learning out of the incident.

there are 20 questions all in techinical paper and 36 questions in appititude te
st

in appititude thay have given all diagrams and asked to find what comes next

thay are quite easy and i hope if u practice r.s aggraval u can do it easily

for tecnical thay have given 1 hr for 20 questions and for not technical thay ha
ve given only 40 min
and 36 questions

this is the paper i have right now

1. main()
   {
    fork();
fork();
fork();
printf("\n hello");
}

How many times print command is executed?

2.main()
{
 int i,*j;
  i=5;
j=&i;
printf("\ni= %d",i);
 f(j);

printf("\n i= %d",i);
}

void f(int*j)
{
int k=10;
  j= &k;
}  

output is
a 5 10
b 10 5
c 5 5
d none

3.
  some question on pipeline like you have to findout the total time 
by which execution is completed for a pipeline of 5 stages.

4.

  main()
{
   int *s = "\0";

   if(strcmp(s,NULL)== 0)
     printf("\n s is null")p
    else
     printf("\n s is not null");
}

5. 
  some syntax which returns a pointer to function

6.  size of integer is
    a. 2 bytes
    b 4 bytes
    c. machine dependant
    d compiler dependent.

7.max and avg. height of sorted binary tree

a. logn n
b n logn

8.
  some question. like the number was shifted everytime by one and bitwise and with 10000000.
  one was supposed to find what the code was doing.
  I feel the answer was most probably finding decimal value.

9. int a[5][4]
   int is 2 bytes base address for array is 4000(Hexa)
   what will be addr for a[3][4]?
   int is 4 bytes same question.

10.
