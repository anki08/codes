there are 20 questions all in techinical paper and 36 questions in appititude te
st

in appititude thay have given all diagrams and asked to find what comes next

thay are quite easy and i hope if u practice r.s aggraval u can do it easily

for tecnical thay have given 1 hr for 20 questions and for not technical thay ha
ve given only 40 min
and 36 questions

this is the paper i have right now

1. main()
   {
    fork();
fork();
fork();
printf("\n hello");
}

How many times print command is executed?

2.main()
{
 int i,*j;
  i=5;
j=&i;
printf("\ni= %d",i);
 f(j);

printf("\n i= %d",i);
}

void f(int*j)
{
int k=10;
  j= &k;
}  

output is
a 5 10
b 10 5
c 5 5
d none

3.
  some question on pipeline like you have to findout the total time 
by which execution is completed for a pipeline of 5 stages.

4.

  main()
{
   int *s = "\0";

   if(strcmp(s,NULL)== 0)
     printf("\n s is null")p
    else
     printf("\n s is not null");
}

5. 
  some syntax which returns a pointer to function

6.  size of integer is
    a. 2 bytes
    b 4 bytes
    c. machine dependant
    d compiler dependent.

7.max and avg. height of sorted binary tree

a. logn n
b n logn

8.
  some question. like the number was shifted everytime by one and bitwise and with 10000000.
  one was supposed to find what the code was doing.
  I feel the answer was most probably finding decimal value.

9. int a[5][4]
   int is 2 bytes base address for array is 4000(Hexa)
   what will be addr for a[3][4]?
   int is 4 bytes same question.

10.
  implementation of priority queue
  a. tree
   b linked list 
    c doubly linked list.
