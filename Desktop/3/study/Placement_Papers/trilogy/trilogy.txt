Written test contained some questions on data structures.
and the Interview is long (say 3-4 hrs). It also contained
only questions on Data structures. So prepare well
in data structures.
Note: Some questions may have simple answers, but they
are stressing on efficiency.


Exam questions
--------------

1) Given m-n sequence of numbers. Now assume that one number
between m-n is missing and another number is repeated twice.
How do you find the missing number and the repeated number.

2) Convert a given double linked list into a tree. 
with some constraints on how you should form a left child
and a right child and the print the numbers in ascending order.


3) Given a array which represents a tree. Find out
the distance between two elements.


4) Given two trees, you have to identify whether they
are isomorphic.

5) Given a binary tree create a circular linked list
such that the numbers should be in order.


 
Interview Questions
-------------------
Round 1

Q1. C program was given, asked to find output.

main()
{
int *a=new int;
*a=6;
foo(a);
cout << *a;
}
foo(int *a)
{
 a=new int;
 *a=7;
}

Q2. Array of size N is given. Random no. generator function was given
that can generate numbers in range 1...K. You need to fill array with
values between 1 and K (no duplicates) and there should not be any 
pattern (or relation) between values stored and indices at which values 
are stored. Extra memory should not be used.

Q3. Linked list is need to be split into two lists such that alternate
elements need to go into different lists. Write program for this.

Round 2
=======
Q1. Write binary search program, but instead of returning boolean,
function needs to return the minimum index of value that is being
searched. What is the complexity?
eg: 1,2,8,8,8,1 and search value=8 should return 3.

Q2. Array of size n is given, and one value in array is repeated n/2 times, 
where n is even. Write algo to find the value. Complexity? The remaining 
n/2 elements are unique.

Q3. Implement insert and delete operations of queue using stacks. What is 
the complexity?

Q4. A sorted array of size A is given. Another array of size A+B is given 
and there are only B elements in that array in sorted order. (Remaining A
elements are empty). Now you need to fill A remaining elements from first
array and resultant array should be in sorted order. Provide algo for this.
What is the complexity?
