STM came for both IC design and embedded system
groups. The paper for embedded systems group is
already posted.

TI came to iitm only for Analog jobs..though they
allowed CSE ppl also to the test, they didnt take any.
The written test consisted of 3 sections. We have to
answer any two. One on analog design, two on digital
design and third on Data structures and algos. As i am
from CSE, i can tell u only Data Structure and Algo
questions.

1) Some OS related question..what signal to caputure
Ctrl+C in some application.
Ans: SIGINT not SIGKILL

2) Some code for transposing a matrix is given..we
have to answer what it does.

3) One tree is given. Write the topological sort
output.

4) Some code with ANDing operation and right shift.
The ans is it prints the binary equivalent of the
number.

5) Inorder traversal on binary search tree gives what?
ans: the sorted order as the output.

There are 5 more and all are very simple. To my
knowledge, the above questions are the only toughest.

Next was an aptitude test. All the questions are very
easy but time consuming..I remember a little about it
since i didnt write it seriously.

Good luck.
The pay for STM was 4.35 Gross and 5L CTC.
For TI, some 4.5 Gross.
