Interview

Total 25 were short listed for direct interview.
And some 75 more for 2nd written test.

Those who were called after 1st written test were
mostly from CSE branch and were interviewed for
Bangalore IDC for Server Technology.

And those who were called after 2nd written test were
called for Hyderabad IDC for E-Biz solutions.

I attended for server technology.

Just be casual and confident.
There were two rounds of interview.
Both were technical.
1st one was some 15 minutes long and the other one
went for some half an hour.

The 1st interview was taken by only one person while
the 2nd one was taken by a panel of 2 senior members.

Finally 12 were short listed for 2nd interview.

They will ask everything what you have mentioned in
the resume. So be careful while preparing it. Just
strike out all those technologies with which you are
not comfortable even though you have used somewhere.
Put some databases projects in it.



1st Interview.

- To write a C program to find if a given string is a
part of Fibonacci series or not.
(Actually a tricky question, as we are not given a
character array, rather one string of numbers is
given. So the main part is to find the starting number
of the series.
Say string is &#147;23581321&#148;; here series start
with 2 and than 3 and so on. So task is to fine
whether 2 is starting number or 23 or 235.&#148;

Basically they are looking for some O (n) solution.

- Again question on servlets, JSP, CGI/Perl.
- Advantages of Java over other programming languages.
- Difference between Java and C++.
- What is in-order traversal in trees?
- How you could do level-order traversal in trees.
