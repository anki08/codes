questions 9-12: Read the passage given below and answer the questions that
follow.Albert Einstein once said: "I never think of the future, it comes
soon enough". One aspect of the future that can never come soon enough is that
of greater autonomy.  In film-making, though, autonomy is frequently stifled
by the unequal possession of capital and the voices of the many are simply
marginalized.  Alternatively, autonomy can be undermined by the predilections
of the owners of capital,as in the studio system where formulas are devised to
meet market-researched standards at the cost of creativity or
experimentation.Most perniciously though, any act of investment constricts
autonomy by creating a structural dilemma, the necessity of recouping
investments - without which future production is endangered.  The expensive
nature of 35mm productions thus exerts an all too obvious pressure on
film-makers, which drives commercial cinema towards the safety of numbers and
tried-and-tested content.  Unsurprisingly then, lowest common cultural
denominators and universal themes often determine what is popular
cinema.Digital video as a technology promises empowerment through an
improved set of opportunities, which far outweigh its constraints. Autonomy in
digital film-making (the making of digital format motion pictures) is derived
from its relatively low capital-intensity requirement.  This, in turn, reduces
the break-even constraint.  The broadcast quality bare essentials can be
rented for upwards of $200 per day (though actual cost is entirely contingent
on the intended nature/sophistication of the production).  A& a generalrule
though, the scale effects that dominate the production requirements of
traditional formats are toned down enormously.  An immediate consequence is
the increased ability to take risks with form and content.The essential
thrust of digital film making is liberal democratic as it increases the
spectrum of output and also protects diversity by allowing for niche markets
to be satiated.  In occupational terms, the relative affordability of digital
video also allows for the studio apprentice system to be replaced by greater
hands on experience for first time film makers who believe that creativity can
transcend experience.Another significant feature of digital vide is its
relative immunity against the heavy handed tactics of parochial politics.  It
is hardly the case that India lacks brave political and social cinema.
However, producing and protecting such produce become easier when it is in
digital form.Digital video's subversive capabilities are obviously double
edged:   The role of audio tapes, as a decentralized, low-cost medium, in
furthering communal tension in the early 1990s has been well documented. It is
a truism that decentralized mediums, which promote the freedom of speech, need
not always promote what you want to hear.  Nonetheless, high quality
audio-visual dissent can strengthen human rights and provide unique
perspectives: Palm sized digital cameras for example have been usedfor
sensitive undercover investigations and war reporting.Presently, digital
film-making is dogged by significant constraints.  One is the capital
intensive nature of the computer based editing and post production equipment
where rentals can range from $20 to $ 200 per hour. A more awkward question is
whether digital video will gain widespread acceptability amongst audiences
despite its less than cinematic visuals.  One complicated alternative is for a
digital film that looks commercially viable to be transferred to 35mm for
theatrical release. A more promising alternativelies in newer distribution
channels that seek to broadcast over the Internet an broadband.Recent
innovations in video compression technology, together with increased bandwidth
availability on fiber-optic networks, promise to substantially increase the
download speeds and visual quality of such streaming video.  Research in the
US also suggests it may eventually be possible for digital films to be
downloaded from satellites to digital cinemas, thus allowing for an important
part of the cinematic experience to be retained. Ultimately we can hope that
the seemingly inexorable progress of technologywill carry digital films
towards greater sophistication and viability.Digital film-making should thus
be seen as an incipient challenge to the unifying nature of global production
for global markets. As such, it is an alternative to not the replacement of
traditional techniques and content. Its produce will thus complement 16mm
indie (independent) and guerrilla cinema that also challenge the formula
system. A significant example of this techno-aesthetic approach is the Dogme
95Manifesto a statement of intention adhered to by fiimmaking away from the
special effects and large budgets of Hollywood and back to storytelling and
innovative camera work. Critically acclaimed works in this genre include
Festen (which addresses sexual abuse within families), The Idiots (which
addresses societal notions of deviancy), and two Oscar nominated
documentaries, The Buena Vista Social Club and The Farm.9.     According to

originalityC. lack of research on market demandsD. prevalence of 35 mm
productions10.   Which of the following is an advantage of the use of
digital video technology?A. Low cost in film production.which paves way for
