Hi Rani and all,
          AMDs telephonic interview .....
I had it and it is OK........
I am a VLSI student and
Questions cover .....
Digital Logic Design( FF setup hold times, FSMs,etc...)
Verilog..............
CMOS ckts...and some technology Qs,
MOS device.....
Low Power.......
Compu Arch....( if u say that u know and u r comfartable with it)
 
The Qs u'll  b asked depends on courses you took and ur resume........so all the areas may not be touched.......
 
List Of Qs ( I was asked)
Are u comfartable with Verilog......
*Differentiate Blocking and non blocking assignments....
* what is the "===" operator in verilog used for.
* what is diff b/w Mealy and Moore FSMs?
*Which one is used for Combo logic and which one for Seq Logic.....
* How do you set/reset FULL and EMPTY flags in a FIFO ( one of my mini project was on    FIFO)
  -- how do you update write read pointers and what kind of counters do u use N why
  -- At what freq do you check for FULL condition ( write /read).
*Realize  XOR gate using  2:1 MUX
* A D flop has its Qbar o/p connected back to its D input...what does the ckt do....
* Two  D flops are cascaded and between clcok i/ps of them combo logic of delay Tc is given if  Ts is setup time Th is hold time what is the Max CLock Freq...
 *8085 Qs ...simple program......
 *8086 Q flag reg structure....etc...
* do you know C/C++ , Perl???
*Compu Org ( If u say that you know Compu ORG, If u donno No prob....)
 what is a cache?? why is it used???Comment on size....
 what is cache consistency?
 what is write back and write through cache??
 what is a TLB?
 what is the throughput rate of a N stage pipeline system??
What is pipelining ...what are the stages in a five stage ppeline of Pentium ( Don't B surprised if u r asked Qs on intel Archs........., they know that we donno AMD proc arch).
what are adv and disadv of Pipelining...
what are Hazards in pipelining???
*Why don't use a large buffer to drive a heavy load???
*what is Vt and on what factors it depends...
*what is Latch up ...how do u avoid it???
*what are various capacitances in a cmos circuit.....
*What is Electromigration?
* How do you transfer data b/w two different clcok domains ( I mean sys with diff clocks)?
*What are the various options for reducing power in sys using CMOS technology??
*What is the present technology Node being used for Processor design ( If I am not wrong it's 90nm technology node).....
*Q on Technology scaling and variation of parameters..
* what is ERC?????
well I don't remember all Qs , Hope this helps u........
 
Some of the Qs (areas )   friends faced....
MOS capacitances.....
doubling input CLOCK with combo logic.
BJT MOS which is preffered for HF appl.....why???
ckt theory....( RC diff integrstors...)
C programming ( generating Random num b/w 1 and 100....etc).
 
So VLSI people don't forget ....
FFs , Timing issues, CMOS ckts( inverters, nand stuff),logic families, MOS device.....
 
and for COMPU people.......
COMPU organization is a must ,,, no prob for u guys I think.....
Better u find with some compu guy/gal............
 
Good luck....
 
cheers
Ram :-)
