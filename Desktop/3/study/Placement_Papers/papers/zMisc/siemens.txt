  THIS PAPER CONSISTS 6 PARTS.    all are multiple choice q's
 1)general
 2)c/unix
 3)c++/motif
 4)database
 5)x-windows
 6)ms-windows
  we have written q's not acc. to each part.total 50. q's. time is
sufficient.
if u have basic idea about all of the u can easily answer the paper.

------
1)which of following operator can't be overloaded.
a)== b)++ c)?! d)<=
2)#include<iostream.h>
  main()
{
printf("Hello World");
}
the program prints Hello World without changing main() the o/p should
be
 intialisation
 Hello World
 Desruct
 the changes should be
a)iostream operator<<(iostream os, char*s)
os<<'intialisation'<<(Hello World)<<Destruct
b)  c)   d)none of the above
3)CDPATH shell variable is in(c-shell)
a) b) c) d)
4) term stickily bit is related to  a)kernel
b)undeletable file
c)  d)none
5)semaphore variable is different from ordinary variable by
6)swap(int x,y)
{
int temp;
temp=x;
x=y;
y=temp;
}
main()
{
int x=2;y=3;
swap(x,y);
}
after calling swap ,what are yhe values x&y?
7) static variable will be visible in
a)fn. in which they are defined
b)module "   "    "        "
c)all the program
d)none
8)unix system is
a)multi processing
b)multi processing ,multiuser
c)multi processing ,multiuser,multitasking
d)multiuser,multitasking
9)x.25 protocol encapsulates the follwing layers
a)network
b)datalink
c)physical
d)all of the above
e)none of the above
10)TCP/IP can work on
a)ethernet
b)tokenring
c)a&b
d)none
11)a node has the ip address 138.50.10.7 and 138.50.10.9.But it is
transmitting data from node1 to node2only. The reason may be
a)a node cannot have more than one address
b)class A should have second octet different
c)classB   "      "    "       "        "
d)a,b,c
12) the OSI layer from bottom to top
13)for an application which exceeds 64k the memory model should be

14)the condition required for dead lock in unix sustem is
15)set-user-id is related to (in unix)
16) bourne shell has
a)history record
b)
c)
d)
17)wrong statement about c++
a)code removably
b)encapsulation of data and code
c)program easy maintenance
d)program runs faster
18)struct base {int a,b;
base();
int virtual function1();

}
struct derv2 : base
 {int a,e;
}
base::base()
{
a=2;b=3;
}
derv1::derv1(){
b=5;
c=10;d=11;}
base::function1()
{return(100);
}
derv1::function1()
{
return(200);
}
main()
base ba;
derv1 d1,d2;
printf("%d %d",d1.a,d1.b)
o/p is
a)a=2;b=3;
b)a=3; b=2;
c)a=5; b=10;
d)none
19) for the above program answer the following q's
main()
base da;
derv1 d1;
derv2 d2;
printf("%d %d %d",da.function1(),d1.function1(),d2.function1());
o/p is
a)100,200,200;
b)200,100,200;
c)200,200,100;
