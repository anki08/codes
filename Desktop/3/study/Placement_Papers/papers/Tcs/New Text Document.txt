Consider the following passage for answering questions 43 to 47.

A program is written to accept an answer to the query "enough fo the Day?"
If the respons is "N" then the program accepts quantity purchased and rate
of the item and displays the amount to be collected. Then the above query
is again displayed and the loop continues.  At the end of the day, when
the response to the above query is "Y", the day collections are displayed.

The program checks that the quantity purchased is between 25 and 125 and the 
rate of the item is between 10.00 and 75.00.  If any of these two conditions
are violated, the program displays an appropriate message and asks for next
input.  The amounts are displayed with proper editing.  The program is written
assuming that there can be  a maximum of 1000 transactions a day.
