        i.        Whether  i will take the value 0

       ii.        Find value of i

      iii.        Find value of a

       iv.        Find value of j


 Answers:

        i.        Yes

      iii.        13

       iv.        29


 2) One more flow chart. Five questions


        i.        s value at 6th iteration

       ii.        value f3 when n=6

      iii.        f3 doesn't take which value

       iv.        When s=57 what is the value of f3

        v.        What is the value n when program terminates.


 Answer

       i.        31

      ii.        34

     iii.        9

      iv.        89

       v.        11


 Formulae involved in the flow chart:  

 S = N2  - ( N – 1)

 F3 = F1 + F2

 F1 = F2

 F2 = F3



 mug this flow chart.. same flow chart came for us..it is very 

 difficult to remember the ques.. i am sorry that i cudnt able to 

 reproduce.. for the 3rd Section i remember few que:

       eg: given words are say ..ABCD , JKLM,  OPQR,  UVWX,  EGHI  

            in this the last set do not follow the pattern.. 

 in case of ABCD- all are continious.  JKLM , OPQR, UVWX..follow same all are continious ..

       

 If u see the EGHI – this is not continious as EFGH shud me there..got it …


 U have 4 ques on this..easy one..

 Ques asked is find the number that represents Strong Tall and Fair 

 persons.. easy one ..

 So u have 3 ques on this pattern.. 


 8) u have ques on flow chart..easy..very simple..
