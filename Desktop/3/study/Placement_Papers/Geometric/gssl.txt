 ---------------------------
                         SECTION-A

  you should write the programs for the following problems in C.

  1. swapping two variables x,y without using a temporary variable.
  2. a program has been given asking to find the output
         ans. it is algorithm for finding G.C.D
  3. write a program for reversing the given string.
  4. the integers from 1 to n are stored in an array in a random
     fashion. but one integer is missing. write a program to find the
     missing integer.
         ans. idea. the sum of n natural numbers is = n(n+1)/2.
              if we subtract the above sum from the sum of all the
              numbers in the array , the result is nothing but the
              missing number.
  5. some bit type of questions has been given on pointers asking to
     to find whether it is correct from syntax point of view. and if
     it is correct explain what it will do.(around 15 bits).

                         SECTION-B

    ANSWER AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.

  6.& 7. two programs on pre-processor directions has been given asking
         to find the output.
  8. simple question given on pointer
     a) kernighan & richie page no. 122
     b) schaum series  page no. 323
     try to understand the pointer problems given here he asked to explain
     in the interview if answer it in exam.
  9. write a c program to find whether a stack is progressing in forward
    or reverse direction.
  10. write a c program that reverses the linked list.

   GUIDELINES:
      the interview is very tough he is asking to do the problems in
    front of him. he is also giving some new problems to solve before him.
    you should have a very good funda of C language.
   From iit-kgp only two 2 students have been selected.
