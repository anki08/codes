Iam sending u texas paper which I have got.

    in this paper there was 20 questions as follows in 60 minutes .
    second part consists of 36 que. in 30 minutes all questions are
    diagramatical.(figurs)..

    c. link-time
    d. load-time

    15.
    two program is given of factorial.
    one  with  recursion and one without recursion .
    question was which program won't run for very big no. input     because
of stack overfow .
    a. i only  (ans.)
    b. ii only
    c. i& ii both .
    c. none

    union b
    {
    char a;
    int b;
    int c;
    };
    which is correct .
    a. size of a is always diff. form size of b.(ans.)
    b. size of a is always same  form size of b.
    c. we can't say anything because of not-homogeneous (not in ordered)
    d. size of a can be same if ...

        so try for qus in  rs agerwal
        see rs agerwal for statements and assumptions qus.
        cut off will be around 30 out of 105 Bso place only the known problems
so
        place only correct problems.
        the above 35 qus are enough to qualify

1. In 1978, a kg of paper was sold at Rs25/-. I f the paper rate increases
at 1.5% more than inflation rate which is of 6.5%  a year , then what wil
be the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years?
a)29.12 (b) 29.72 (c) 30.12 (d) 32.65 (e) none of these
2. In A,B,C are having some marbles with each of them. A has giben B and C
the same number of marbles they already have to each of them. then, B gave
C and A the same no. of marbles they have, then C gave A and B the same
no. of marbles they have. At the end A,B,and C have equal no. of marbles.
         (i) If x,y,z are the marbles initially with A,B,C respectively.
then the no of marbles B have at the end
         (a) 2(x-y-z) (b) 4(x-y-z)   etc.

         (ii)If the total no. of marbles are 72, then the no. of marbles
with A at the starting
         a. 20 b. 30 c. 32

3. If a car starts from A towards B with some velocity due to some problem
in the engine after travelling 30km.If  the car goes with 4/5 th of its
actuval velocity the car reaches B 45min later to the actual time. If the
car engine fails ofter travelling 45km, the car reaches the destination B
36min late to the  actual time , what is the initial velocity of car and
what is the distance between A and B in km
ans) 20 & 130.

4. A person has Rs 100/- in his pocket, he can as 25 pencils or 15books.

i) During this period which share has undergone max fluctuation?

ii) In which month it is possible to buy B and C selling A?

iii) In which month the share values are very low?

iv) By purchasing one share of A and 4 each of B and C in the beginning of
the period , to get max profit when this shares should be sold?
v)  ?

7. In a computer institute 9 languages can taught. The module is of 6
months duration and only six languages  each of one month can be taught.
In addition to that BASIC is always there and should be in first month
itself
# word perfect is to be taught in the preceeding week of word star.
# FORTRAN can not be taught until COBAL is coarsed prior to that
# BINO, FIFO never be taught in single module
   languages are BASIC, WORD STAR, WORD PERFECT, FORTRAN, COBAL, BINO,
FIFO, LOTUS, C

i. Of the following which module is possible based on above conditions.

ii) If word star is in 3rd month , what could be in 6th month.

iii) If COBAL is in the 2nd month and BINO in 6th month are there in
addition to the above condition, FORTRAN will be in which month.

10. In a square , all the mid points are joined. the inner square is
shaded. If the area of the square is A, what is the shaded area?

11. two questions on basic angles i.e given a circle, a few chords or
diameter is drawn etc.

12. @(a,b)= (a+b)/2
     /(a,b)= a.b

 Hai
Iam here sending the cisco paper which i have(Recent).I will search for
the remaining papers .Whenever I will get those papers i mail it to u.
all the best.

CAUTION: There is a -ve marking of +1 & -1 u dont mark blindly.Mark the
answer if u know exactly.cutoff will be 25 marks out of 60.So becareful.
hai ,
     There r 2 sections in CISCO
                   section 1: Aptitude 20 marks (10 aptitude,10
analogy,oppositewords etc))

                 section 2:comp sc(data structue,c,theory of
computation,networks,operating systems)

I collected upto 20 questions;

In this setion questions exact numbers I have forgotten.So this will be
useful to the style of the problem only.


SECTION 1:
1: A man went to market with some money.With that money he can buy 15
pencils or 25 pens.He kept 15% of that money for bus fare and with rest of
the money he purchased 5 pencils,and 'x' pens.How many pens he purchased?

2:A man climbing a wall.For every 4 steps go up he will slipdown 2
steps.If he takes 12 min to 3 steps.how much time it takes to climb 48
meters and one step=2meters.

3: Two trains with lengths x and y ,and speeds u and v.Approaching each
other how much time it takes to takes for faster train to cross other
train?
     In this question I don't remember the x,y,u,v.U can find formula in
  Aggarwal's quantitative aptitude book
4:
  there was some question on ages that was easy

Section2:

1.
  main()
      { fork();
        fork();
        fork();             printf("hello");
         }
       How many times it will print hello?
2:
 char A[5,6]
  How many bytes it requires?

3:Bridges are used in which layer?

4.Bigendian means
        a)lower byte stored in lower address
        b)lower byte stored in higher address
one of these is correct.u can verify in Any micro processor book.

5:
  #define mmx 10+10

   printf"%d",mmx*mmx);

6: main()
 {  j=0
       for(i=0;i<10;i++)
             {
                 j+=i;
             }
     }
     what is the value of i & j at the end of the loop
  ans: 10,46

7: Regular expression with 2 consecutive 1's and all string of 0's and 1's

8:
dead lock conditions 1 question


9:
 selective repeat widow size of sender & receiver 1 question.

10;Balanced trees 1 question
I will try to collect some more questions
                       all the best.
