paper of texas instruments.
Technical + aptitude + interview.
* Questions on c
here i am not strictly following syntax it is just to show what was asked.
1 #define sum(a,b) a+b
value of sum(2,3)*2  Ans:8

2. a=5,b=6
swap(&a,b);
This function is written to swap a and b
find value of a and b . Ans 6,6

3.
function()
{
static int a=0;
a=a+1;
return a;
}
main()
{
function();
function();
function();
printf a;
}
final value of a ? Ans : a=3. static initializes once.
4.Write two prog. to swap a & b without using temp variable.
5.
unsigned char i;
int sum=0;
for(i=0;i<300;i++)
sum=sum+i;
printf(sum);

Ans:Program will held in infinite loop b/c i can not exceed 255.

6.
five questions on MOSFETS.
four were having single mosfets.
questions were simple.as i told u in Gwalior.
just on the funda that it will conduct if Vg-Vs > Vt .

In one question output at drain was to be calculated while o/p was initially
charged to 5v and to the gate 5v were applied.

In one question output at drain was to be calculated while o/p was initially
charged to 5v and the gate was shorted to drain.
7.
Clear the concept of settling time , hold time and other times. 3 ques on that.
like values of various delays were given and max frequency at which the circuit can work
hint : 1/sum of all delays . In our case ans was 200 Mhz.

8. An input and output  waveform was given and circuit was to be designed with the use of one
delay.
   Ans : exor gate in which second input is first input with a delay.

9. A question to determine sequence of counter. Don't get puzzled it was a
tough question.

10.The output and input of a inverter is connected by three RC stages in
between of each stage two amplifiers with poles at imaginary axis were
connected.
Hint : The poles at imaginary axis will create extra 180 phase shift thus the
circuit will oscillate and calculate the frequency of operation.

11. A series  of infinite connected rc circuit and overall input resistance is
calculated.(question of 12 class)

I could remember only these questions . I think  3 more questions were
there. These were  to be done in 1 hr . so time is enough do all questions
patiently.
After that aptitude test of half an hour was there in which only one type of
questions were there and those were of finding missing figures .
