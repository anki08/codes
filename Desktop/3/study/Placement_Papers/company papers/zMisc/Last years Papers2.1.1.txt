don't know the color of the back side of eachcard.4 persons A
B C and D are sitting on the table before the cards. They can
see Red, Green Red and blue .Out of the 4 poeple 2 always lie.
They see the color on the reverse side and give the following
comment

family has as many sisters as brothers but each girl has
twice as many brothers as sisters. How many brothers
and sisters are there?
ans: 4 boys and 3 girls.
2. No. of animals is 11 more than the no. of birds. If the
no. of birds were the no. of animals and no. of animals
were the no. of birds( ie., interchanging no.s of animals
and birds.), the total no. of legs get reduced by one fifth
(1/5). How many no. of birds and animals were there?
ans: birds:11,animals:22
3. In a soap company a soap is manufactured with 11 parts.
For making one soap you will get 1 part as scrap. At the

1) There are two balls touching each other circumferencically.
The radius of the big ball is 4 times the diameter of the small
ball.The outer small ball rotates in anticlockwise direction
circumferencically over the bigger one at the rate of 16 rev/sec.
The bigger wheel also rotates anticlockwise at Nrev/sec. what is
'N' for the horizontal line from the centre of small wheel always
is horizontal.

 Q)  Strike off any digit from each number in seven rows (need not
 be at same place) and combine the same operations with 3 digit numbers
 to get the same addition. After this strike off another digit from all
 and add all the No.s to get the same 2 digit No. perform the same
 process again with 1 digit No.s. Give the ' no.s in 7 rows at
 each stage.

3) there is a safe with a 5 digit No. The 4th digit is 4 greater than
second digit, while 3rd digit is 3 less than 2nd digit. The 1st digit
is thrice the last digit. There are 3 pairs whose sum is 11. Find
the number.  Ans) 65292.

4) there are 2 guards Bal and Pal walking on the side of a wall of a
wearhouse(12m X 11m) in opposite directions. They meet at a point and
Bal says to Pal " See you again in the other side". After a few moments
of walking Bal decides to go back for a smoke but he changes his
direction again to his previous one after 10 minutes of walking in
the other(opposite) direction remembering that Pal will be waiting
for to meet.If Bal and Pal walk 8 and 11 feet respectively, how
much distance they would have travelled before meeting again.

path.

7) Ramesh sit around a round table with some other men. He has one
rupee more than his right person and this person in turn has 1 rupee
more than the person to his right and so on, Ramesh decided to give
1 rupee to his right & he in turn 2 rupees to his right and 3 rupees
to his right & so on. This process went on till a person has
'no money' to give to his right. At this time he has 4 times the
money to his right person. How many men are there along with Ramesh
and what is the money with poorest fellow.
