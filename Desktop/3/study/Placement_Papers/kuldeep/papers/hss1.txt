>>-----------
>>Systems (my research area), operating systems and Software Engineering
>>
>>Explain U'r research work.
>>
>>What is a Real-Time System ?
>>What is the difference between Hard and Soft real-time systems ?
>>What is a mission critical system ?
>>What is the important aspect of a real-time system ?
>>
>>Explain the difference between microkernel and macro kernel.
>>Give an example of microkernel.
>>Why paging is used ?
>>Which is the best page replacement algo and Why ?
>>
>>WHat is software life cycle ?
>>How much time is spent usually in each phases  and why ?
>>Which one do U want to work if selected in Honeywell ?
>>( I said I don't like testing )
>>They asked why ?
>>I said it is a boring job. Then they tried to analyse
>>the knowledge in testing.
>>
>>What is testing ?
>>Which are the different types of testing ?
>>Then they explained the way they do testing. They said that they are
>>doing testing in requirement phase and design phase so that if any
>>problem comes in those phases it is not ncecessary to go back and
>change
>>the requirement or design. All the test processing is automated.
>>
>>Why do U want to join Honeywell ?
>>Ans : To get a practical feeling of Real-time systems.
>>
>>Do U know C++ ?
>>How good are U in C and C++ ?
>>Rate U'rslef in both C and C++. ( 1 - 10 marks)
>>
>>Second round (around 45 minutes )
>>------------
>>They wanted a bio-data at the time of inteview. I gave the placement
>>office bio-data and in that one there was column 'Major subjects
>>studied'. Many of the questions came from those.
>>
>>Explain U'r research work.
>>Lot of questions from it.
>>
>>What is a distributed system ?
>>Some questions about CSP. ( I kept quiet)
>>Which languages do U know ?
>>What are the differences between Pascal and C.
>>I said Pascal is a strongly typed language.
>>Then what is typing  and its advantages ?
>>Then he asked some questions from Compiler construction and Lisp.

>>Still a lot of questions from software engineering .
>>Which are the different phases in Software life cycle (asked again)
>>Why is analysis and testing phases very important ?
>>Which methodologies are U familiar with ?

>>Have U worked in windows ? (Yes)
>>What is the difference U have seen from a Dos environment ?
>>I said it event driven .
>>So what do U mean by event driven ?
>>How do WinMain look like ?
>>How the messages are processed in Windows ?
>>(Queue of events)
>>What are parameters needed to distinguish an event ?
