The question paper consists of  1.Non tech (math,phy,chem,reasoning)
=55marks
                                                  2.technical(respective
branch paper)  =20 marks

       Nontech  same for all branch

here in this paper i m giving for electrical branch paper.
for technical q's for comp & E&C i will mail u those q's tomarrow morning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 1

can't choose more than 4 questions from a group 
29)A goes towards north 2km,then turns right move 4 km,then right 4
km,then right 4 km
  in which direction is he after the first turn (ans west)
30)what is the dist bet the 1st and last point in the above question
31) two group of people x,y,z and a,b,c,d. cond z does not agree to c so
also a to b and y to a.three questions depending upon this in which you
have to select a group of 2 peopleif one is fixed in a group you have to
find the other.

a) observer is steady rods move paralally  with  the measured length
b) rod steady observer is moving 
c) in which case measured length is max.

35)out of which data you can measure the length of  the shadow, height of
man is 6 feet
a)length of the poll is 12
b)man stands at a dist of 12 feet from the pole
36)a train moving with constant vel. V a nucloid exploids into 2 parts
.the dist. Bet. 2 particles after t sec is x.what will be the dist..
ans(x)
37)two trains t ans d s are moving with constant vel. From a and b ,c is
the mid point 
betw. Them..
38)A,B,C are to be choosen along with 5 persons.what is the prob .that
they will be in a sequence.
