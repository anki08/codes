                             Q1. if A is an odd no
                             (1)Then A is multipal of two prime nonither
                             of them 2
                             (2) (A+5) is devided by 5
                             of what is the value of the x
                             (1) 6(2) x is divesible both by 3 or 5
                             Q2 a man starts at A at a speed of 4
                             miles/hour.a another man B
                             starts at spped of 10 miles/hour after 4 hour
                             from the starts of
                             A. where they will meet from the starting
                             pont.
                             Q3. smallest 3 degit no when devided by 6
                             leaves reminder 5 and
                             when
                             devided by 5 leaves reminder 3. ans 143
                             q4. heigest power of 5 that devides 30! ans 7
                             Q5. A man covers a distence at a certan speed
                             of half the
                             distence
                             covered by double the time then what is the
                             ratio of speed.
                             Q6. which polygon has no of diagonals equal
                             to the no of sides.
                             Q7. Cost price of 40 article is equal to the
                             selling price of 16
                             article.then waht is the percentage yearn and
                             loss.
                             Q8. if the ratio of no is 2:3:4 such that
                             their sum of
                             square=2900
                             then what are the no.
                             Q9. sn={s1,s2,s3.....Sn} and sequence is as
                             an={a1,a2....an} now
                             if
                             a0=1 and a1=2 and given that ax=a(x+2)-a(x)+1
                             then a4=?
