Subject: [iitbatch2001] Mentor graphics paper (IISc)
In Mentor graphics written test CS students have to
attempt 7 sections. They are :

        1. General Software
        2. C and C++
        3. Datastructures
        4. Operating Systems
        5. Compilers
        6. Computer Architecture & Microprocessors
        7. General Aptitude

        char *t;
        int i;

        t = a[4];
        a[4] = a[3];
        a[3] = t;

        for(i = 0; i <= 4; ++i)
                printf("%s\n", a[i]);

}
        Ans : compile time error

                5. Compilers
                ------------
(We attempted very few questions in this section)

1. 3 address code is used in which stage of compilation ?
        Ans : Intermidiate Code generation 

Some questions on Grammer

..
..

 
       6. Computer Architecture & Microprocessors
        ------------------------------------------

1. 176 in base 12 is :..........

2. The string "ABCDEFGH" is stored by  processors P1 & P2 as 
   shown below
  
   P1           P2

   0x2000 AB   0x2000 GH
   0x2002 CD   0x2002 EF
   0x2004 EF   0x2004 CD
   0x2006 GH   0x2006 AB

   ans) P2 little endian & P1 big endian 
        ( lsb is at lower address -> little endian)

3. cache coloring is used for solving 
   a) cache coherence
   b) to reduce cache misses
   c) to increase hit ratio
   d) 

4. A cache is 2-way set associative, 
   cache block & cache line sizes are given
   how many bits are used for indexing into cache ?

5. for a 16 bit micro processor, clock freq is given as 6MHz. 
   For instruction fetching and decoding it takes 5 micro sec. 
   for storing in to memory it takes 2 micro sec. 
   Then howmany machine cycles are needed for the 
   execution of mvi A 06h

6. Processor P1 clock freq is less than that of P2, 
   but P1 is faster in execution in time. the reason may be 
   a) P1 is implementing by pipelining
   b) P1 exploits locality of reference
   c) a & b
   d) P1 can't execute faster than P2 .

   ans) c

                        7. General Aptitude
                        -------------------
So many questions are there, they are infact easy.
You can try there itself

All the best
