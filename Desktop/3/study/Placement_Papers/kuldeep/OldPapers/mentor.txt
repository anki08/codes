  exact questions i don't remember,but can give a broad view of the 
paper....
The paper had 6 sections.....
1.General S/w - very basic questions abt s/w n analysis were asked,like 
something abt the system designer,you can just commonsense was checked in 
it....
2.Operating System -questions on bootstraping,process management,file 
system,process synchonization were asked....
3.Computer architecture-questions on cache, virtual memory, pipelining, 
performance.......
4.Data Structures -lists,stacks,queues,binary trees...
5.C,C++ - questions like what is the o/p of the code were asked,topics 
were arrays,pointers,#define,structures,unions,c++ nothing was there but C 
shud be gud ,some questions using printf fundas were asked....
6.Analytical-maths questions were there,percenatges,linear equations,n 
generall maths,one type of questions were like that 2 statemenst were 
given n a question was asked ,we have to answer whether 1 is sufficient 
for answering,or 2,both,either of them or none,they were quite easy.....
   this is all abt the written,exact questions i don't remember.......

interview was quite cool-
questions on C were asked,in C++ constructors,destructors,virtual 
unctions,inheritance,function overlaoding,overriding,operator 
overloading....
in OS,they asked semaphores,unix file system,process,threads......
most of the questions were in C,they didn't asked me CA as i had not taken 
the course but they said that ur basics in CA are clear,we need that 
only,so i guess they want basics of CA also.....

this is all i can recall.....hope it is of some use for someone......
wish my gud luck to the person!!!!
