II section
----------
1) A tree and a car are connected by an infinitesimly elastic chord. the
distance between tree and car is 100 m. the car started moving away from
the tree stretching the chord at a speed of 100kmphr. simultaneously, an
ant started walking from the tree towards the car at 1.5kmphr. will the
ant reach the car? give explanation.
2) there is a board consisting of 8 X 8 squares. it is covered with
rectangles of size 2 X 1. so all the squares are covered. now two squares
from opposite
corners are removed. so can the remaining squares be covered
completely? Give
explanation...
3) what is the value of i and j?
(i) for(;--j && j++;)
    {
     j|=1;
     j&=1;
    }
(ii) i = 1<<31;
     while(i)
     {
      if(i&j)
       j|=i;
      else
       j&=i;
      i>>=1;
     }

4) Given the following:

Instructions         Operands       Description
-----------------------------------------------
ADD/SUB              O1, O2, R      R = O1 +(-) O2

SHL/SHR              O1, O2, R      SOME LEFT SHIFT AND RIGHT SHIFT
                                    OPERATION..I FORGOT THIS..

JZ                   L              JUMP TO L IF THE RESULT OF PREVIOUS
                                    OPERATION IS 0

RZ                                  RETURN FROM THE FUNCTION IF THE RESULT
                                    IS 0.

AND/OR/XOR

O1, O2 and R can be immediate datas or registers. they operands can be
present in more than one instruction. write a program to multiply 2
numbers which are in R1 and R2. result has to be in R3.

5) i did not get time to read this question properly. but it was like...
some fuctions are given which take integer numbers as arguments and
generate an integer. write a code for finding the function which gives
maximum value.
