Subject: veritas '02 paper at IISc


this is part of the veritas paper of this year....
1) f(0) <= f(1) <= f(2) <= ...
  g(0) <= g(1) <= g(2) <= ...
  h(0) <= h(1) <= h(2) <= ...

 That is given three monotonically non-decreasing functions asked us to 
give
algorithm to find the smallest common value such that

 f(i) = g(j) = h(k) for some i, j, k


2) Given an array consisting of both +ve and -ve numbers ... give a O(n)
algorithm to find the max subsequence sum (standard problem see Allen 
Weise
book)


3) Given a hetrogeneous circular doubly linked list with the following
node definitions

  struct A {
    char data1;
    int  data2;
    void *ll_prev;
    void *ll_next;
    int  thisdata;
  };

  struct B {
    int data1;
    chat data2;
    int data3;
    void *ll_prev;
    void *ll_next;
    int thisdata;
    char data4;
  };

Each node 'thisdata' field which denotes whether it's ll_prev and ll_next
point to type A or Type B node ...

  thisdata = 1  -- Type A node
  thisdata = 2  -- Type B node

Your given a pointer to the first node of the list ... the first node
is of type A.  Give an algorithm to add a Type B node


4) Consider the following function
int X = 0;

  void somefunc(int p, int q) {
     int i;

     for(i=p; i<q; ++i) {
        somefunc(i+1, q);
        ++X;
     }
  }

If q>p always ... give a formula/expression to determine the no.of times
variable X is incremented in terms of p and q.

the objectives will be on os algo c etc
 best of luck
