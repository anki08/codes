for TI aptitude test consist of all pictorial questions. ie in
        each question he will give 8 diagrams and ask to find the
        9'th diagram in that sequence.
        You go through RS Agarwal. These aptitude questins are
        very easy. Just pratice them. In RS Agarwal gothrough
        SERIES chapter. It is suffient. There are 35 aptitude 
        questions. First 25 are very easy. Do these questions
        in just 15 or 20 minutes. Because last questions are
        very touch.
