there is separate test for h/w and s/w.



this is h/w paper.







1. implement f = ((a+b)c)bar  ( bar is complement:here bar is for whole 
expression.) in static cmos design and compare the no.of transistors 
wwwith the implementation of nand/nor/inv.







ans;  6 for static cmos and 10 for nand/..







2. implement 5:1 mux with 2:1 mux only..draw the truth table







ans :  4   2:1 muxes are needed and 3 control signals are used







3. designa synchronous counter which counts 0,1,2,3,4,0.... use D or JK 
ffs.







4.defind transconductance of a fet or bjt. and derive it  for high gain 
region.







5.an inverter is driving an RL circuit. output is taken across 
inductor, input being given to inverter..inverter with 0 delay and Rl values 
are given..a waveform with 0 for some time and 1 for sometime is 
given..draw the output.







6.two problems on biasing circuits 1.transistor with base resistor and 
collector resistor both tied to vcc..find vout, if vcc, r values and 
beta of the bjt aregiven.







7. transistor and op amp..







8.an inverting op amp is given..find out the gain..







9. input is driving 3 inverters in cascade and the output of the last 
inverter is driving a cross coupled 2  nand gates ( basic flip flop). 
for this cross coupled structure, the other input is coming from the main 
input..from the top nand gate output is the main output..delays of all 
the gates are given..an input waveform with 0s and 1s are given ..draw 
the o/p waveform..







another 2 questions are there..i couldn't remember..







MY interview questions:







1. FSMS



2.implementations of fsms in vhdl



3. setup time and hold time



4. is there any current flowing thru a gate in steady state?



5. why the delay in  a gate.



  i told him that the capacitaces have to be chrged or discharged.



6. ddoes the power dissipation in a mos gate depend on the 
transistyors.



  i told them the resistance of transistor comes into picture..but it 
is wrong..



the power depends on vdd,capacitance and switching frequency..it 
doesn't depend upon the transistor.



7. how to make a T ff from Dff



8. about my project.







generally, they are concentrating on digital..



he didn't get satisfaction about my project..







all the best..

		HARDWARE PAPER.



bOTH S/W AND S/W are compulsory.





1. to find out stack fault of a 3 input nand gate how many necessary

    input vectors are needed

2. solving k_map  Ans: b+c



3.parity generation i.e even parity

ANs : c



4. nand gate becomes --- gate for negative logic    Ans:  OR



5advantage of cmos over nmos :  ans:  Low power dessipation



6.adv of syncronous  ckts on async. ckts



7 5 problems on addressing of memories



8.function of ale in 8085



10.A voice signal sample is stored as one byte. Frequency range is 

20Hz to 16hz. What is the memorysize required to store 4 minutes 
voice

signal? 

Ans 15MB



11)What will the the controller do before interrupting CPU?

ANs : stores the data into its memory and then interrupts the CPU.



and other are digital fundamentls



12) In a normalised floating point representation, mantessa is 
represented by 24 bits and exponent with 

8 bits using signed representation. What is range?



14) stack uses             Ans: LIFO





15) Where will be the actual address of the subroutine is placed for 
vectored interrupts?



Ans: Fixed location.







CONCENTRATE ON DIGITAL LOGIC( GATES, RAM ADDRESSING, NO OF BITS 
REQUIRED,)
