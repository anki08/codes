Motorola Interview.
There was a Technical Interview,followed by personal interview.  
Mainly concetrating on the interesting subjects. 


write a C code 
1.to reverse a string using a recursive function, without 
   swapping or using an extra memory.
2.To reverse a linked list as above.

given a macro like
  #define MAX(A,B) {to return that is larger}
     what will MAX(i++,j),MAX(i,j++) return.

Difference between Macro and ordinary definition.
Difference between Class and Struct.

Testing and Maintenance.(will you work in it and what are they)

Give the outputs of a compiler and assembler and loader and linker etc.
If a new data structure, suppose a queue is to be added like int, long 
etc.,
where shall the changes be -- lex or yacc or where.

what is a Real Time OS.
Name some.
Describe VRTX in few words.
How does the scheduler know the time how it should be scheduled.


sockets, TLI, streams.

and much about project.

What is deadlock? How do you avoid it?
What is a semaphore?
What exactly happens after each system call in sockets, both at the 
client and at the server.
What is the difference between widget & gadget in XWindows?
Tell about strtok & strstr functions.

1. antonym
       p....  ans. static


3. there are six question of series.
   1 2 3 5 8 ?  ans.
   102 204 102  ans. 256
   questions are very easy .you can solve easily there.
4. word1 : word2 = motorola :    ..... ans . c
5 . this type are question are asked.
            1      2        4
                10      ?
             3      4        ...
6.   instruction to add 3 .......     ans. 4The paper consists os three sections.
1. aptitude 15 questions 20 min.
2. system concepts 20 questions 20 min.
3. 'c'   15 questions 20 min.

NOTE:::::

I'm sendin the questions, many of them  have no answers. U do check the
answers  for all the given questions also.

All questions are MULTIPLE CHOICES ONLY.

U do try to cover the related topics to get some understanding.
In interview They are asking C C++ Operating system concepts
and Networks.
They will ask about Ur interesting subjects, U try to have good
grip on those intresting subjects.

They asked about c c++ project work and operating systems.
Don't worry, prepare well, get it, All the best.


section 1::::;

*. GRE book test paper 3 section 5
question no. 8 to 12     (ships WXYZ starting on dec. 23rd..........)


* 5 programs are sheduled from monday to saterday, monday is not holiday,
PQRST are the programs. Theday before P is holiday, and some other clues are
given, we have to find the sequence (4 questions)

ANS: tuesday is the holiday
     P comes on wednesday ,
     U can do the remaining very easily.
* Suppose U R the presoner, There are two guards Who will tell truth or
one will tell truth. There is a gate for liberty and another foe hell.

Some questions are given, like
    i. are U tell truth?
    ii. another tell truth or not??
    iii. both of U R telling truth??
    iV. both of U lieing??
    V. --------------


    they gave  a. b. c. d. and asking about which sequencing is sufficient to
    find the gate for liberty??
    ( I can't give exact thing)
 
* There are WIFE and HUSBAND at one side of river. They have one child,
They want to cross the river. The child can't be lonly. The boat boy won't
permit morethan one to cross the river, what is the correct way to
cross the river??

* There are 7  targets, A B and C has to shoot them. All should be shooted 
consicutively.
    1. The no. of chances for A and B are not less thn 2,
    2. for C there is only one chance.
    3. A can't shot 3 times consicutively.
    4. B is permited to shoot in even chances only.

    They have given some 3or 4 questions on this

*

   void  main(void)
    {
     int i=200;
     {
      int i=100;
      print the value of i;
      }
      print the value of i
      }
      what is the output?


      may be 100 200
11.

   int x=2;
   x=x<<2;
   printf("%d ",x);


   ANS=8;
12.
     
int a[]={0,0X4,4,9};     /*some values are given*/

int i=2;

printf("%d %d",a[i],i[a]);

 what is the value???   (may be error)

 13.
     some other program is given , I can't remember it
     U can get it afterwads,

     the answer is 3 3, so U can check this in the exam. itself.
