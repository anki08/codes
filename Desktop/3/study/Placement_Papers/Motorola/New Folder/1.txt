
THERE WILL BE TWO OPTIONS ,EITHER YOU CHOOSE SOFTWARE PAPER OR ELECTRONICS PAPER.

OBVIOUSLY YPU WILL CHOOSE ELECTRONICS , ALSO YOU CAN GIVE DSP PAPER WITH ELECTRONICS AS ADDTIONAL (IT WILL BE OPTIONAL ,OBVIOUSLY YOU WILL GIVE THIS ALSO).

THESE BOTH PAPERS(ELECTRONICS & DSP)ARE VERY EASY AS COMPARE TO TEXAS.DSP PAPER WILL BE VERY-VERY EASY.DONT WORRY I WILL TRY TO GIVE WITH MY BEST EFFORT ON MEMORY BASE

QUESTION'S ORDER MAY CHANGE 

ELECTRONICS PAPER


1. ONE VERY SIMPLE QUESTION ON SIMPLIFICATION OF BOOLEAN EXPRESSION.


2. IN PAPER LAST QUSSTION IS ON DESIGN OF SYNCHRONOUS COUNTER FOR COUNT 0->1->2->3->4->0->1->2->3->4->0- - - - 

THIS QUES. IS OF 6 MARKS & VERY SIMPLE, SO TRY TO DESIGN CORRECTLY WITH SPEED. 


3. A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION ON OPAMP, YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT OUTPUT &INPUT RELATIONSHIP.

I THINK ANS. IS Vo =11 Vi

4. AN FIGURE IS GIVEN LIKE BELOW. INPUT IS GIVEN IN PULSE FORM (LIKE CLK. ).

YOU HAVE TO FINDOUT OUTPUT PULSE, IN CKT. THERE IS CROSSCOUPLED NAND GATES.

N ONE NAND GATE INPUT IS DIRECTLY AS Vi BUT IN ANOTHER NAND GATE SAME INPUT IS 

GIVEN AFTER TWO DELAYS USING TWO NOT GATES HAVING DIFFERENT DELYS. NOW YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT OUTPUT PULSE

9 nsec

|---------------|-NAND GATE-------------/---------V o/p

V i/p | |----------------|------------------\

--------|-------inverter-------inverter--|------NAND GATE----\---- 6 nsec 8nsec 9nsec

delay

 

 

5. A TWO INPUT AND GATE IS GIVEN.INPUT IS A PULSE, AT ONE INPUT PULSE IS GIVEN

DIRECTLY ,AT ANOTHER INPUT PULSE IS GIVEN AFTER SOME DELAY.YOU HAVE TO FIND 

OUT OUTPULSE.


A _____________and gate_____________ B

|

|

A ______delay________|

10 nsec

 


6. A OPAMP CKT IS GIVEN, IN WHICH NPN TRASISTOR IS USED IN FEEDBACK. YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT OUTPUT.I AM NOT REMEMBERING THIS QUESTION BUT DONT WORRY THIS QUESTION IS NOT

DIFFICULT TO SOLVE ,YOU CAN DO IT EASILY.

 

KAUSHAL I AM VERY SOORY IAM NOT GETTING ANOTHER QUESTIONS..I QUALIFIED BOTH THESE 

TESTS,SO YOU CAN QUALIFY THESE TESTS VERY EASILY.


DSP PAPER

THIS PAPER IS VERY-VERY EASY.I HAVE DONE IT 85% CORRECTLY. THERE IS NO NEED TO


4GIVE QUESTIONS.WELL I AM GIVING SOME CLUE.

1. WHAT IS 2'S COMPLEMENT OF 2 IN 8 BIT MACHINE.

2. WHY FIR IS BETTER ,4 ALTERNATIVES ARE GIVEN.

3. CASUL & NONCAUSAL SYSTEMS ARE STABLE WHEN---- POLES & ZEROS CONDTIONS ARE GIVEN. 4.------------

ALL QUESTINOS ARE VERY EASY SO DONT GET WORRY.
