> b.f(n) is O(g(n)) for all c & k such that f(n)>c*g(n)
> for all n>k;
> c.
> d.
> 
> 2.on doubling the problem space f(n)=2^N the
> complexity becomes
> a.square
> b.double
> c.four times
> d.reaches very high value
> 
> 3.which of the following is mot conducvise to use
> linked list
> a.sequential search

> d.
> 
> 5.how would u define postfix operation in c++
> a.it cannot be defined becoz it requires oblect on its

> 7.in C no. of ways of passing arguments
> a.pass by value only
> b.pass by value & pass by reference
> c.pass by value & pass by pointer
> d.pass by reference only
> 8. same as question (7) (choices are also same) but in
> C++
