                     Ans. 8
2). A soldiar looses his way in a thick jungle  at  random  walks 
from his camp but  mathematically  in  an  interestingg  fashion.  
First he walks one mile east then half mile to north.   Then  1/4 
mile to west, then 1/8 mile to south and so  on  making  a  loop. 
Finally hoe far he is from his camp and in which direction.
ans: in north and south directions 
   1/2 - 1/8 + 1/32 - 1/128 + 1/512 - and so on 
                = 1/2/((1-(-1/4))
      similarly in east and west directions
     1- 1/4 + 1/16 - 1/64 + 1/256 -    and so on

  first : I have three childern. Thew pproduct of their ages is  36 
.  If you sum their ages . it is exactly same as  my  neighbour's 
door number on my left. The  sacond  mathematiciaan  verfies  the 
door number and says that the not sufficient  .  Then  the  first 
says " o.k one more clue is that my youngest is the youngest"
Immmediately the second mathematician answers . Can  you  aanswer 
the questoion asked by the first mathematician?

balls left out  as that of blue ". Which box is the one he  solds 
out  ?
Ans : total no of balls  =  89 and (89-29 /2 = 60/2 = 30

                   NOVEL  NETWORK PAPER
        *********************************************

The paper consists os three sections.
1. aptitude 15 questions 20 min.
2. system concepts 20 questions 20 min.
3. 'c'   15 questions 20 min.

NOTE:::::

I'm sendin the questions, somany have no answers. U do check the
answers  for all the given questions also.

All questions are MULTIPLE CHOICES ONLY.

U do try to cover the related topics to get some understanding.
In interview They are asking C C++ Operating system concepts
and Networks.
They will ask about Ur interesting subjects, U try to have good
grip on those intresting subjects.

They selected 11 out of 55 students.
 They asked about c c++ project work and OS,NETWORKS.
But they selected only 2 , one from CS and another is BTech ECE.


SECTION 1 is main factor selection to the interview


---------------------------------------------------------------
In the interveiw you should be very active .And should be frank to say 
no also.One CS student said that he don't know NETWORK and he hasn't 
taken NETWORKS subject.But he has selected.
      OK  BEST OF LUCK.

   what is the value of    sizeof(a)/sizeof(char *)
   a. 4 b.bytes for char c-- d.--
( we don't know the answer)

5. void fn(int *a, int *b)
   {
    int *t;
    t=a;
    a=b;
    b=t;
    }
    main()
    {
     int a=2;
     int b=3;
     fn(&a,&b);
     print the values os a and b;
     }
     what is the output--- out put won't swap, the same values remain.

     a. error at runtime
     b. compilation error
     c.2 3
     d. 3 2
6. 
#define scanf "%s is a string"
main()
{
 printf(scanf,scanf);
 }
 what is the output.

 ANS : %s is string is string

7. i=2+3,4>3,1;
   printf("%d"i);

   ans is 5 only.
8. char *p="abc";
   char *q="abc123";

   while(*p=*q)
   {
    print("%c %c",*p,*q);
    }

    a. aabbcc
    b. aabbcc123
    c. abcabc123
    d. infinate loop ( this may be correct)
9. printf("%u",-1)
what is the value?
a. -1 b. 1 c. 65336 d.  --


(maxint value-1   I think, check for the answer)

10. #define void int
    int i=300;
   void  main(void)
    {
     int i=200;
     {
      int i=100;
      print the value of i;
      }
      print the value of i
      }
      what is the output?


      may be 100 200
11.

   int x=2;
   x=x<<2;
   printf("%d ",x);


   ANS=8;
12.
     
int a[]={0,0X4,4,9};     /*some values are given*/

int i=2;

printf("%d %d",a[i],i[a]);

 what is the value???   (may be error)

 13.
     some other program is given , I can't remember it
     U can get it afterwads,

     the answer is 3 3, so U can check this in the exam. itself.

     I'll send the remaining two afterwars whenever I get them. OK !
