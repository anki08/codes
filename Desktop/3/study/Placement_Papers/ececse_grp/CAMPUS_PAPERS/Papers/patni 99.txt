* * * *----------------------------------- two transistors are connected Vbe is 0.7volts .this is simple ckt.one
transistor is diode equivalent. & asked the o/p across the 2 nd transistor.
2.simple k map ans is Bbar.

-----R------I----------o/p
|___R____ |
in above r is resistence.I is cmos inverter.
then ckt is used for:

5.simple amplifier ckt openloop gain of amplifier is 4.V in =1v.asked for
V x?
amplifdier + is connected to base. - is connected to i/p in between 5k is
connected.
from o/p feedback connected to - of amplifier with 15k.this is ckt.


6.resistence inductot cap are serially connected to ac voltage 5

9.2 d ffs are connected in asyncro manner .clock 10 MEGAHZ.gate delay is 1
nanosec.
A B are the two given D FFs.asked for AB output is:


a.updown
b.up c. updown glitching like that (take care abt glitching word)

|___HPF____|

the ckt is LPF ,HPF or APF ?

11.in a queue at the no of elements removed is proportional to no of elements
in
the queue.then no of elements in the queue:
a.increases decreases exp or linearly(so these are the 4 options given choose
1 option)
12.with 2 i/p AND gates u have to form a 8 i/p AND gate.which is the fastest
in the 
following implementations.
ans we think ((AB)(CD))((EF)(GH))
13.with howmany 2:1 MUX u can for 8:1 MUX.answer is 7.
14. there are n states then ffs used are log n.
15.cube each side has r units resistance then the resistance across diagonal
of cube.
16.op amp connections asked for o/p
the answer is (1+1/n)(v2-v1).check it out.practise this type of model.
