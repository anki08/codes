hi ankur
here in our college
17/59 in tronix
18/60 in comp sci
have been placed
paper ot tata elexi is as follows

There is a technical paper which is of 40 mins duration with 30
questions ( all objective type with a,b,c,d options) - 30 marks 
no
negatives.

The paper deals with-
c++ programming ( classes and inheritance) - emphasis is 
on
constructor destructor logics. Most of the questions are output
based.......that is u have to choose the output the code will
give..

C programming ( Pointers and Printf) -- this is also 
almost
totally output based

A few sample questions that are in the paper are.--

1. Give the output for
main()
{
int i=0;
printf("%d%d%d", i,i++,++i)
}

2. What is the error in the function
calloc(10,0)

3. How many bits are needed for 120 instructions
ANs. 7 ( since 2 to the power 7> 120)

4. If ( i=0,5,7) the last E is ......


Then there is an aptitude paper [ 20 mins, 30 questions] most
numerical ----- 30 marks.

the questions are mainly on

1. work and time ( man days concept)
2. Upstream Downstream ( relative velocity )
3. Tank and cisterns.
its basically the kind of apti given in the R.S. Agarwall
textbook.

In the interview the questions are from the following subjects
only.....they are looking for people who are sharp in

1. Operating Systems.
2. Microprocessors.
3. EDC
4. Networking.
