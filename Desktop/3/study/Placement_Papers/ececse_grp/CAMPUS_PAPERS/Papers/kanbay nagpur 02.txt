is easy but go through RS aggarwal. see don,t get dissappointed if
other
sets come, the thing matter is that you should be mentally prepared .
.as
far as I am concerned do well in GD but not extraordinary and one thing
if
you can do is that when they come to your college go to receive if you
can
that will be a plus point in interview. then I think nobody can stop
you
from getting a job. GD TOPICS were "whether true relationship should be
maintained or not" And " mercy killing" . interview is mostly personal
and
bit technical.WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.First test is logic. 30mins 30
ques. If
