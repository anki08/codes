Paper critriea
        Section A       20 bits  10 minutes     Quantative
        Section B       20 bits  15 minutes     Analytical

Section B
I) The letters A,B,C,D,E,F and G not necessarily in that order,stand for
seven consecutive integers from 1 to 10
        D is 3 less than A.
        B is the middle term.
        F is as much less than B as C is greater than D.
        G is greater than F.
  1. The fifth integer is
  2. A is as much greater than F as which integer is less than G
  3. If A=7,the sum of E and G is
  4. A-F=
  Like the above questions you may expect other
  Ans: The order of the integers is E F D B C A G By this order you can
  answer to the above questions.
