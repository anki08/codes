       Folloing services are operated by Asian airlines between the
two cities Rampur in India and alexandrea in Timbuktu. The two cities
are located in different countries with different time zones.As is
normally done, the time shown is the local time viz IST and TST(timbukta standa
rd time.)

                      Regular time            supersonic flight
 Depart Rampur         8:20 IST                 9:50 IST^
 Arrive Alexandrea     17:10 TST               15:40 TST
 Depart alexandria     20:50 TST               22;50 TST
 Arrive rampur         23:40 ISt               ? Ist

    The arrival time of supersonic flight into rampur from Alexandria
was clearly printed in the time table. Can you calculate the arrival
time of the supersonic flight assuming each servce_Regular and Supersonic
maintain as own constant speed of flight.
