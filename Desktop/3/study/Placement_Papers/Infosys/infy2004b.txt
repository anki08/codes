closed circuit. After pedaling for several minutes, he found that 1/3 
rd of the cyclists ahead of him and 3/4 th of the cyclists behind him 
together formed the total no. of  participants. How many were 
participating in the race? 
Ans:13
Solution:  
Since it is a CIRCULAR LAP the boy can    count all the other  boys 
(except him) as the no.  of boys in-front of him.
     Similarly the no of boys behind him are, all the boys except 
him.So both r same let it be  x==( all   the boys except him.)
     [(1/3) * x]  +  [(3/4) * x]  ==  x  + 1
     since x + 1 == total no.of boys (including rahul)

(a)    A, B, C
(b)   A, D, E
(c)    A, D, F

(10). A Boy `A' bought a Hat & Suit for Rs.15. His Girlfriend
`B' 
bought a Suit with as much as cost of A's Hat. Then with
remaining 
money she bought a Dress. The dress costs one rupee less than 
A's 
hat's  cost. Then she told him that had they used their hat money
to 
buy hats such that her hat costs 1 ½ times his hat they would have 
spent  equal money on their purchase. The boy asked ", Can u tell
the 
cost of my hat I bought?".
1.      Answer it.
2.      How much they spend altogether ?
Ans: (1)6.5  (2)29

SOLUTION:
-------------
Let s  == suit;  h==hat;   d==dress;
s(a) + h(a) =...........(i)
h(b) + d(b) ==?............(ii)
since h(b)==s(a) given ......(iii)

(ii)->  s(a) + d(b)== ?
   given d(b)==h(a)-1.....(iv)
      ->   s(a) +h(a) -1 == ? ==>(15 -1)

therefore, (ii) =-1 == 14  ==> h(b) + d(b)  =…..(v)
Had they bought hats at some Rs:x and Rs:(3/2)*x (ratio of 1 : 1 1/2)
with their hat money their  purchases would have been be equal i.e 
Suit A + hat A  == Hat B + Dress B       ……..(vi)
Now their hat money was  == h(a)+h(b)
                    from(iii) ==> s(a) +h(b) =
dividing 15 in 1 : 3/2 we get 6,9

(vi) ==>
S(a)+ 6 == 9 + d(b)
S(a)+ 6 == 9 + h(a) - 1
s(a) == h(a) + 2

from (i)substituting s(a)=-h(a)
==>15 - h(a) == h(a) + 2
h(a)== 13/2 == 6.5

total money == 15+14=)       from i and v

A 's hat==6.5               B's Hat == 8.5   
A 's suit==8.5              B's dress ==5.5
(1) 8.5 + 6.5 == 15     (TRUE)
(2) 8.5 + 5.5 == 14(B's hat is 1 less of A)(TRUE)
(3) had they bought hats at 6 and 9 Rs (1 : 1 1/2)their     purchases 
would have been be equal i.e 
Suit A + hat A  == Hat B + Dress B
    8.5 + 6 == 9 + 5.5(TRUE)
Hence these values r the correct answers.
