amsung India Software Operations (SISO) visited IITM
on 13-14 of
August.
They took 16 ppl. 11 PGs and 5 Btechs. Out of 11, 9
PGs are from CSE
only.

There was a written test by name Samsung Aptitude Test
(SAT) and next
interview and next is HR.
1) Written test:
60 minutes, 50 questions.
First 25 are on mathematical ability and next 25 on
some reasoning.
Matehmatical ability includes: 90% of the questions
are on data
anlalysis. Remaning questions anybody can answer.
Questions on data anlysis mean: u will be given some
data in the form
of either bar graphs, or tables, or curves..We r given
data on flight
rates, no. of publications in a R&D organisation, the
production info
in a company...
Questions will be too simple but time consuming. They
may ask quesions
like: what is the area in which the ratio of no.of
publications to
professors is the highest.
Remaining questions in mathematical ability u can
easily answer.

Reasoning: Several questions include some series is
given ..find the
missing number.

Out of 150-160 ppl they shortlisted 40 ppl for
interview. (25 PGs
(12-CS,13-EE) and 15 Btechs).

Interview: There are 2 panels each of only 1 person.
They asked only
about the projects u did. Wheneve u finish explaining,
the interviw is
over.
some times u may face questions like "What is CDMA?",
"how (++i)+(++i) works?"
"some OS memory mgmt and other very small basic
questions.

Next everybody should face HR. It is very cool. It is
just for noting
down some info about u.
Ur course, CGP, any ranks previously, Gate scores,
academic records..
tell about urself?, what u want to know from samsung?
ur weakness and strengths?
"
Thats all.

If u have good academic record and did the SAT lill

get it.
