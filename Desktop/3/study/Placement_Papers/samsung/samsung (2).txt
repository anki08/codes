Subject: SAMSUNG paper


hai...

  this is samsung paper, which i gave in the last week.

there were 2 sections 1.Technical 2.Aptitude

technical was a bit difficult than apti.

in technical there were mainly questions on Datastructures, OS and
Networks.

networks questions were mainly from datalink layer and network layer.

DS questions were on linkedlists,binary trees and hashing.

OS questions were on paging and schduling.

in apti they have asked to arrange sentences in order, questions based
on passage and some direct
apti.

some ques i have in mind are, i am giving answers after the question
itself:

1. what is the size of IPv6 ---16 bytes

2.how many possible trees are there such that both preorder and
postorder traversal are same if there
are n nodes in a binary tree ---0

3. four ques were given on error detection and control, like CRC
code,hamming code etc..

4.which protocol is used to convert the ethernet address to IP address
--- RARP

5.which is undeterminnistic network structure among 802.3,802.4,802.5
--802.4

6. some nodes were given and they are inserted into a binary search
tree, which is the root --- 8

7. which of the two codes executes fast

     for(i=0;i<100;i++)
        for(j=0;i<100;j++)
            a[i][j]=0;

    for(i=0;i<100;i++)
        for(j=0;j<100;j++)
            a[j][i]=0

  ans: first code

8. int j=3;
     int *p=&j;
    printf("%d %d", *p++,++*p);


   it will not increment j value as ++ is done first on p before *, so
address gets incremented and
garbage value will be there.

9. two questions were asked on doubly linked lists, for deleting a node
like given some piece of code
which is correct.

10. a question on interrupts in OS, what happens when a higher priority
process requests the CPU
when it is servicing a lower priority process.

11. a question on quick sort, given some   numbers what happens after
the first iteration.

 these are the questions i remembered...if i get idea of any other
questions, i'll mail later...........


bye and goodluck,
