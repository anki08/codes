STM paper has been already posted once, by chakka raj dated around August 22.
There were 2 sections which came for recruitment, VLSI(hardware) and
Embedded system software.
Iam doing Comm and Signal processing in Kanpur with ECE back ground. I
had chosen embedded system software.
question paper seems to be varying from institute to institute. We got
completely different paper But similar questions.
                                                                                                                             
there were 2 interview, Technical and HR
For me it was 1 hour and 45 mins duration.
in first interview, they completely on 8085 and Computer Architecture,
Common quest was what is the difference between microprocessor,  micro
controller and embedded system.
                                                                                                                             
Then in HR he was asking mainly about ourselves, like what U like
most, what do U see most in other people, what people tell about U and
somany quests like that.
                                                                                                                             
For Embedded systems section, they have selected 12 people for
interview and 5 went to HR and finally 4 gotten it.
