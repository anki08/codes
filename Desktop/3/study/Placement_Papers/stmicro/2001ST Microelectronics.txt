
Hi ,

The stm (MLNR 2001) paper is as follows:
Paper consists of determining the o/p of c/c++ prog.
Of c u can do it but for c++ part
Go thoroughly through it .
It consists of 2 sections in 1 section u have to write
the o/p & in 2 section more than 1 answer are
correct.

1.the entity which keep the address which the compiler
uses to call by seeing the content of pointer.( it
was question of late binding u have to tell the entity
which keep the address)
a.one argument constructor
b.one argument destructor
c.v table
d.symbol table

2.
char newchar=’1’;
char &a=newchar,b=newchar,c=newchar;

a a,c,b,are character
b.a is a reference to char,c,b are charater
c.error
d.

3question on virtual fn

4. question on this pointer
a.
b.
c.
d.

5. destructer
a.cannot have return type
b.can accept argument
c.virtual destructer
d.

6.diagram of gates consists of NAND OR gates u have to
tell the o/p

7.voltage across capacitor with laps
a.v(t)=s(t)*l(t)
b.c.d.

8.no of nodes in full binary tree of depth of 3
3 4 8 15

9.no of nodes in a complete binary tree of depth 3
5 8 15 3

10. o/p of printf(“%d”,printf(“hello”));

11. using namespace
main(argc,argv)
{
if(int x=150)
{
cout<<”x is 150”;
x=100;
}
else
cout<<”x is 100”;

a.code will not compile
b.150
c.100
d.code will give run time error

12. const int *ptr
which is correct
a.a pointer to integer constant
b.
c.
d.

13.what is wrong about binary tree
a.every non-root node has exactly one parent
b.
c.
d.

after that we have two section we have to choose one I
go for section a.it consists of 5 question (multiple
choice question)
1.diagram of gates are given we have to tell the
o/;p.so go through the NAND OR gates.
2.a Boolean expression x+ x(x+y)(y+z) something like
that given we have to convert it to SOP form.
3.no. of address & o/p lines for 20 X 32
4. no. of sequence for k bit Johnson counter( ans k
check it)
5..
.
