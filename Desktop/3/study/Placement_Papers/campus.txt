As far as getting departmental jobs is concerned, these are the main
category for which companies recruit: DSP/COM, analog and digital. For
DSP/COM EE301/320. Just fo thru first few chaps of text books. 

In analog sections, there are some simple basic-level (<EE311) questions
on ckt design. Understand when a tr is in linear region etc, whats gain of
a ckt, some simple designing problems using opamps. Basics of MOS tr is
also required. Sample q include why shud one go for NAND gates instead of
NOR ones, when shud MOS tr be prefered over BJT etc. 

In digital part, they ask questions upon number representations, different
kinds of adders, making OR/AND gates using MUXes, finding max clock speed,
K-Map, designing FSM for detecting some bit stream etc.

Now, some questions which are asked with prob=1:
1. Given a (ganda) network of Capacitor, Resistor and Power Supply, find
out the transient output voltage at some node. Basic ESCO202 funda, but
sometimes its tedious and one needs to approximate things..
2. Defn of set-up and hold time in digital ckt. Finding maximum and
minimum clock frequency in a drawn net. Any modification suggested for
inprovement.
3. Designing FSM.

They never ask state-of-art things, never go for big q, just keep asking
simple basic level q. Just want to ensure that the person has the basics
right.
