---------------------------------------

[1] What are the current trends and areas of focus in IT.

My Ans. Talked about emerging trends of S/W Engg and ISO 9000 stuff

(gave vague ideas about them as I don't know much nor do I care 

about these topics myself ;-)). Then mentioned the proliferation of O-O

methodologies and their usefulness in speeding up development process,

code re-usability, ease of maintenance, ease of bug-fixing.

Thirdly, mentioned the work going on in High-Speed N/w - FDDI, ATM,

Fast-Ethernet(100Mbps). Told whatever little I knew about ATM in

response to another question.

[2] What is a Micro-Kernel architecture.

My Ans. This is a developing area in OSs where instead of building the

kernel as a single monolithic structure starting from scratch, it is

built as a set of layers. The micro-kernel provides only the bare-bones

like Device-drivers, rudimentary filesystem support etc. on which,

depending on the intended area of application of the OS, it can be

customized to provide various higher level OS features like

Multiprocessing, IPC, etc.

implemented? How page faults are handled? 

Seems to be a favorite question for these chaps ---- Maurice Bach. 


b) Write a macro in C for swapping two nibbles in a byte.

-Use the shift operators and be careful while defining temporary 

variables( if you do so) as you have to write a macro. Otherwise

it is pretty simple.

c) What is the CPU-scheduling policy in Unix? - Round robin scheduling

with multilevel queues.

d) Diffrence between short term, long term and medium term scheduler.

swapper. (See Taenenbaum and/or Peterson)

e) Name various page-replacement policies. Which can be implemented

both with and without pre-emption? - see Peterson.

f) Describe the Sliding window protocol. What is it's advantage

d) What is re-entrant code? --- Non-self modifying code. Can be 

shared by many processes simultaneously. Gave e.g. of text-editors

Counter Q: But then no code modifies itself. What does 'non-self 

modifying' mean? ---- I don't know for sure.

e) Diff between compilers and interpreters. Some fundaes about

how to link code in different files.

Always play safe and give a deadline by which time you are sure to

Tips: Be confident, frank (But need not give away information which may weigh

against your case), free (use first names while addresing them, so be

alert when they introduce themselves) and cheerful (attend an interview

with a positive frame of mind). Remember you are IITians and you always

have an edge. That may sound arrogant, but its true.
