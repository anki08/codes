ZIMAGE IS A COMPRESSED VERSION OF KERNEL CODE. IT GETS LOADED FIRST AND
THEN EXPANDS TO FILL THE UPPER PART OF MEMORY. 

BZ IMAGE IS NOT AS COMPRESSED AS ZIMAGE. SO A PORTION OF BZIMAGE IS

DIVIDE THE BALLS INTO THREE SETS OF FOUR BALLS EACH.
WEIGH TWO SETS NOW WE WILL KNOW THE SET WITH THE HEAVIER
BALL. THEN ONLY TWO MORE STEPS ARE NEEDED.

LEFT PAN
GOES DOWN,C HOOSE 9 TO 16 ELSE 1 TO 8 IF THE NEITHER PAN GOES DOWN
