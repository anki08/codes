   execution of mvi A 06h.

    ans : 3.5 micro secs

   but P1 is faster in execution in time. the reason may be 

   a) P1 is implementing by pipelining

   b) P1 exploits locality of reference

                       -------------------

So many questions are there, they are infact easy.

You can try there itself

 
Regarding interview:

 They are asking much about C++,datastructures,Algorithms.

Some questions on sorting (which one is a stable sort (merge sort,count sort).

Some questions on virtual function(pure),copy constructure..

The questions were simple.

(some questions are from the written test)

and 

Why would U like to join Mentor??
