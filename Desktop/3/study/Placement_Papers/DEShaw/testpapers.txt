		      TCS 
 
Hi guys, 
Sending u the TCS papers that i could lay my hands
upon here. Please 
distribute it around. 
 
Nikhils... 
 
 
Dear friend, 
In the paper I am sending,there r about 40 vocabulary
questions.But 
this year's paper has only 20 of them.Time 5 min.Marks
10.Do only 
15 or 16 bits correctly. 
 
Quantitative aptitude:I am sending 15 questions.In the
latest paper 
we got, 
there r only 10 of them r present.Time 10 min.Marks
20.Do all the 
problems correctly. 
 
 
Reasoning:All answers r given.Remember them.In the
exam, u willnot be 
having time to read the passages.So remember the
answers. 
I dont remember twohe passages (R and Q).U can read
these passages 
in the exam and answer them.Remember: don't answer all
questions.Write 
7 or 8 incorrect answers.Time 45 min.Total 70
questions and Marks 70. 
 
 
Your ultimate aim is to get 75 to 85 marks.Because if
u get high 
marks, 
they may assune that u know the paper beforehand and u
may be 
disqualified. 
So don't get morethan 90 marks. 
 
 
WISH U ALL THE BEST.

 Dear friend,
 In the paper I am sending,there r about 40 vocabulary questions.But
 this year's paper has only 20 of them.Time 5 min.Marks 10.Do only
 15 or 16 bits correctly.
         
  Quantitative aptitude:I am sending 15 questions.In the latest paper we got,
   there r only 10 of them r present.Time 10 min.Marks 20.Do all the 
   problems correctly.


   Reasoning:All answers r given.Remember them.In the exam, u willnot be
   having time to read the passages.So remember the answers.
   I dont remember twohe passages (R and Q).U can read these passages
   in the exam and answer them.Remember: don't answer all questions.Write
   7 or 8 incorrect answers.Time 45 min.Total 70 questions and Marks 70.


   Your ultimate aim is to get 75 to 85 marks.Because if u get high marks,
   they may assune that u know the paper beforehand and u may be disqualified.
   So don't get morethan 90 marks.

	Regarding Interview:
  you should say everything confidentially, whatever you say tell them
 frankly and confidentially i.e. I will do this, I will definetely learn
 within this period, now I am learning etc. regarding C-language, COBOL, etc.
   they will ask, how can you be best suited to our TCS (or soft ware field)?
  ans:   some of my seniors told that TCS is doing consultancy business in
 soft-ware field, this requires some sort of programming skills, knowledge of
 programming languages, in addition to this it requires a sort of aptitude
 skill  which I am sure of possing it, this I can say based on my past
 academic ahcievements.     Also now I am learning C, I learned up to ....
 (say arrays or functions) I will go through Pointers etc. also I am learning
 COBOL, I am preparing for TCS  C, COBOL test.
  question: Why are you shifting from your mechanical field to software field?
  ans: I am interested in soft-ware field, because of its bright &amp; prosperous
 future and quick recogniton of talent leading to faster growth.
  They will ask about your family members and you, you just simply answer
 the truth frankly, they donot bouther about your father occupation i.e business
 studies, etc.
   question: how can you compete with a computer background student as you
			 are a pure mechanical student?
	ans:  actually I have taken Fortran as one of my courses in B.Tech. degree
 course, now here in IIT I learned --------- languages( something about what
 you learned in IITB), initially I found slightly difficulty to compete with
 a student having computers background, but now I am confident of learning
 programming skills as once I am in the process of learning I am sure of
 achieving this.
here we have first about family, then about 4 minutes talk on my project
 then they questioned on the project, then they asked about soft-ware i.e
 do you know about INTERNET, Y2K problem, etc. I frankly told that I donot know
 about INTERNET, I know a little bit about Y2K problem and explained about
 Y2K problem i.e now in all computers year is indicated by two digits only,
 finally after the 99th year (1999) the computer will treat as 00 year(1900)
 instead of considering it as 2000.   meanwhile one or two question on my
 academic record, about my refrigeration companies, etc.
 if you have a good topic on your project, you tell about that one and
 have a little knowledge on it so you can answer well their questions.

\title{Seminar: COMPUTER VIRUS}
\begin{document}
\newpage

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section { What is VIRUS ?}
\\

   Virus is software program which infects other programs by modifying
them to include an exact version of itself or possibly an evolved
version , a mutation or another generation.The virus can act as
carrier  of any code the attacker wishes to use.The code in the virus 
may spread through the system or network and thereby causing arbitrary
changes in program and data.
\\

\section{What is a Trojan Horse?}

              It is a program that does something
undocumented which the programmer intended, but that the user
would not approve of if he knew about it.  According to some
people, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan Horse, namely
one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns
them into Trojans too).  According to others, a virus that does
not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is
not a Trojan.  Finally, despite the definitions, many people use
the term "Trojan" to refer only to a *non-replicating* malicious
program, so that the set of Trojans and the set of viruses are
disjoint.
\\
\section{TYPES OF VIRUSES:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item FILE INFECTORS:
\\
                This type of viruses attach themselves to ordinary
program files.  These usually infect arbitrary .COM and/or .EXE
programs, though some can infect any program for which execution is
requested, such as .SYS, .OVL, .PRG, & .MNU files.

File infectors can be either DIRECT ACTION or RESIDENT.  A direct-
action virus selects one or more other programs to infect each time
the program which contains it is executed.  A resident virus hides
itself somewhere in memory the first time an infected program is
executed, and thereafter infects other programs when *they* are
executed (as in the case of the Jerusalem) or when certain other
conditions are fulfilled.  The Vienna is an example of a direct-action
virus.  Most other viruses are resident.

\item SYSTEM or BOOT-RECORD INFECTORS:
\\
                                  Boot record or System viruses
 infect executable code found in certain system areas on a disk
which are not ordinary files.   On DOS systems, there are ordinary
boot-sector viruses, which infect only the DOS boot sector, and MBR
viruses which infect the Master Boot Record on fixed disks and the DOS
boot sector on diskettes.  Examples include Brain, Stoned, Empire,
Azusa, and Michelangelo.  Such viruses are always resident viruses.

Finally, a few viruses are able to infect both (the Tequila virus is
one example).  These are often called "MULTI-PARTITE" viruses, though
there has been criticism of this name; another name is "BOOT-AND-FILE"
virus.
\end{enumerate}
 \\
\em{\bf{A CASE STUDY:}\bf}\em
\\
\em{\bf{BRAIN VIRUS:}\bf}\em
\\
           This is example for boot sector virus.This was originated
in january, 1986,in Lahore, Pakistan.It is one of the most prolific
viruses which has infected hundreds of thousands of disks.This virus
infects only 5.25-inch floppies and it cannot infect the hard disk.
The virus stores the original boot sector, and five extension sectors 
containing the main body of the virus, in available sectors which are
then flagged as bad so that DOS or any other program does not use
them.

    On Brain infected computer, total memory available will be 7K less
than the actually available. One of the most visible effects of the
virus is that when Brain infects a floppy,it puts a volume label of 
"@Brain". A DIR command on an infected floppy in drive A will show the
first line as
\\
              \em{\bf{  Volume in drive A is @ Brain }\bf}\em
\\
Effects:
        The original code has no destructive code. Due to its
replication cycle, the virus slows the access of the floppy drive 
and makes 3K of unusable sectors in the disk and 7K in system memory.

Removal:
        As this is a boot sector virus, elimination of the virus from
a floppy requires the overwriting of the boot sector of the infected
disk with a clean boot sector.Elimination is quick and easy by using 
one of the commercial programs. This is especially required if you wish
to recover the 3K  of sectors marked bad by Brain.
\\
\chapter
\em{THINGS VIRUSES CAN DO:}\em
\begin{enumerate}
\\
\item  Fill up your computer with garbage: 
                                      The virus can fill up your disk,
or your available memory, with copies of itself.Or perhaps just with
zeros. 

\item  Mess up files:
                Computer files are stored in standard ways.Therefore
it is very easy to alter things so that parts of files can't be
located even though they may  still be there.

\item  Mess up FAT:
              File Allocation Table, contains information about where
things are stored on your disk, as well as other information. Changing
some of these items of information can cause you no end of grief.

\item  Mess up the boot sector: 
				The boot sector is a special bit of information
on a disk. If it's altered , your computer may not be run at all.

\item  Format a disk or diskette.
\item  Display a message:
                    The MACMAG virus just displayed a
message, harmlessly.

\item Put message into printouts.
\item Reset a computer.
\item Slow things down.
\item Redefine keys:
               Your computer has to be told what a signal from the
keyboard means. A virus could change the definitions in the keystroke
definition table.

\item Lock the keyboard:
                    If the virus deleted the keyboard definitions, the
computer would not respond at all.
\item Change data in program or files:
                                     Some viruses have made random
changes to data files, and you might not notice this for a long
time. Even worse, they could change random data in memory(RAM), causing
erratic program results.
\item Physically damage hard drive or other parts of the machine.
\item Copy data you have access to for another user who shouldn't have
access: 
        This type of problem applies mostly to systems with many
users. If you have access to, say, payroll information or confidential
medical records, a virus could copy it to a place where someone else
without your access level can get at it.                           
\end{enumerate}
\chapter
\em{\bf{ Symptoms of presence of a Computer Virus in Your System }\bf}\em

   How do we know when there is a computer virus  in the system?
Although many of the anti-virus products will warn about an illegal 
operation,it may be signs of equipment malfunctions.
  The following are some of the indicators of computer virus attack:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The number of files on the disk has increased.:
       Every time you add
 a program or subdirectory on your hard disk, it is safe procedure to
obtain a printout of the disk's directory. Keep it handy for reference.
If you use the DIR command at some stage during operation and find
that number of files has increased,then compare the two directories 
and search for new file names.Are they familiar? Examine the contents 
of suspect files using the Norton Utilities or PC Tools.

\item The message " 1 File(s) copied " appears even though no COPY command
 was invoked :
               Have you used a .BAT file which invokes the COPY
command as part of its procedure?Is there a program or utility that
creates a file or files?If we decide to make PC Tools a RAM-resident
file it creates a new file in the root directory. If none of these are 
the causes , there is a good chance that a virus is in the system.

\item The amount of RAM space in he system becomes smaller:
                                                       At boot time
run CHKDSK or the utility or any special utility to determine the
system's RAM size. Make a note of this number. Periodically during
operations run CHKDSK or the utility and find the number of bytes
available in RAM. If the size has decreased, stop! Unless you have
added a TSR earlier during operations, chances are that a decrease 
in available RAM space spells trouble.

\item A file's date/time stamp has been changed :
                                             Give a quick glance
at date and time of executable programs. Unless you or new program
created recently dated files, chances are very high that there is a
computer virus in the system.

\item The size of an executable program has increased:
                                                   Before you execute
a program, take a directory listing. Compare the size of the program 
with the original listing. Any change in the program size should be
suspected. Executable programs do not change in size unless they have
become infected or otherwise corrupted. Do not execute the program 
until the system has been examined and the program replaced from an
original protected copy.

\item A program normally run will not load because of insufficient RAM
space: 
     If you have not added a TSR other than yhose usually installed by
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file on the system.Find the amount of RAM size
available. If it has been decreased, stop! If the size of RAM has not
been changed, use a directory listing to check the guilty program's
size and date/time stamps and compare them with original.If there is a
change in size, date,and or time, chances are the program is infected
and the system might be as well.

\item Programs take longer than normal to load:
                                     Few of us can be aware of minor
time changes in program loading. However, if loading is noticeably 
longer or you feel that longer loading time, terminate program
execution.Obtain a dictionary listing of the disk and compare the 
program's size in bytes and its date and time with the original
listing. Even if there is no change in these data power down.
Run a diagnostic test to determine its operation. If nothing is
physically wrong with the disk drive, chances are that you were 
impatient.

\item Execution time of a program takes longer than usual:
                                                      Sure you are not
impatient? If not, follow the steps taken for longer program loading
in the indicator above.

\item A disk drive light goes on when that disk is not being accessed for
read or write during the current operation?:
                                             This most often means
danger. Yet if you are working with the drive B as the default drive
and take a directory of a disk in drive A, the light on drive B will
go on after the directory appears on the screen.This is normal since
drive B is the default drive.

\item A TSR program fails to operate properly:
                                            Did it work properly under
the same conditions before? We have some TSR programs that cannot be
called by hotkeys when other TSR programs are active. Know your system
and the TSR operations before you call for help.

\item Hard disk access time has increased appreciably:
                                                   Again this might be
your time perception. Although something might be physically wrong
with the drive ,you could possibly have a virus in the system Power
down and restart with a write protected disk drive in A.

\item Program stops in the middle of execution and no disk lights are on:
      The system has apparently crashed;it can be caused by many
things . After you have safely rebooted the system, examine the suspect
program. Also run diagnostics on the disk drives. If nothing is found
it could have been an equipment malfunction.

\item Hard disk drive fails to boot the system:
                                            Try booting the system
with a write protected floppy disk in drive A and obtain a directory
of drive C. Possibly the master boot record,partition table or file
allocation have been altered. Or possibly there is something
physically wrong,such as the hard disk's heads.

\item Bad clusters appear on a disk:
                                 Almost all hard disks normally come
from producers to the users with some bad clusters. Obtain a printout
of the map of your hard disk and keep the location of the bad
clusters.Periodically obtain a map on the monitor screen and compare
it with the original. Any change should be suspect.
\end{enumerate}
\chapter{Prevention Techniques}
\begin{enumerate}
 Three things are involved in coping with viruses:
\item   Avoiding them in the first place.
\item Discovering them and getting rid of them.
\item Repairing the damage.
 \end{enumerate} 
     To avoid viruses to enter into the system:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To be safest, purchase all your programs, shrink wrapped, from a
reputable dealer.
\item Write-protect original diskette before inserting  it into a drive.
\item Make a back up copy, using the original write-protected diskette 
    as the input. Write protect the back up copy to avoid infection.
\item Test any software you downloaded,particularly if it is downloaded
from bulletin boards, before running it.
\end{enumerate}
     There are virus protection programs available in the
market. Vaccine is a program or group of programs, that provides some
kind of protection against computer viruses. It can scan  files for
known viruses and enable users to look for suspicious text in program
files. (such as the apocryphal \em{(HA HA GOTCHA)}\em)Naturally a new virus
won't be found in this way, unless vandal is kind enough to include
funny messages in the code in readable format. The vaccine might
include a memory resident program that traps system calls, TSR calls,
 attempts to format a disk, or attempts to modify a program or system
file. It might also include an automated or manual signature, checksum
or some form of encryption so that programs with altered signatures or
checksums are blocked by the the protection program. For this purpose
some antiviral programs, when loaded first time in the system
calculates checksum to all the files and maintain the list. But if
checksum is calculated for already infected program, it cannot detect.

\chapter{CONCLUSIONS:}

     Since the last decade,software threats have increased and are
spreading exponentially because of improved communications 
(LAN,WAN) , we should be aware of these threats and their
devastating effects. Use one or more antiviral products to
protect the system from virus infection. Update the antiviral
products as and when new viruses are found. But no antiviral
pruduct presently available in the market can offer 100 percent
 foolproof protection. So the best way to avoid viruses is
don't use unknown software. Test the downloaded software
before executing it. Back up your data and files to recover
from the loss due to virus attack.

      1. 9  ii. 10   iii.  11   iv   12    ans: iii.
  
  b.  if i[0]=1 and i[f]=10  what should be the
      log operand?
      i. =  i. >    iii.<   iv.  <=     ans: B

  c.  if i=i-1, what is i[f] if loop is <
      ans: i[f]=0; i[0]=10.

2.  function func(x)

8.  To convert a real to integer by rounding off
    ans: exp: x+0.5

9.  To check the given number m is prime or not, it
    is enough to check the division factors from 2 to ____

10  A 3by3 matrix is to be determined from the following logic.
    State true of False. Whether the logic works. If false
    write the necessary corrections
    a11+a12+a13=magic-total
    loop1:  Do i=2,3
            If(ai1+ai2+ai3#magic-total) go to failure
            end loop1.

    loop2:  Do j=1,2,3
            If(a1j+a2j+a3j#magic-total) go to failure
            end loop 2.
         printf("the matrix is magic")
         printf("the matric is not a magic") 
    Ans: The diagonals are not checked.
    After loop2 the following two statements should be added.
    if(a11+a22+a33#magic-total) go to failure
    if(a31+a22+a13# magic-total) go to failure

11. A logic is given to determine the change given to the 
    customers in a shop. Tell whether the logic is false or true?
    and tell the reason?

   int change;

   change=change-i
   if(change>=0) printf("change to be given"i);
   else
   change=change+i;
   end do loop
   ans:  The logic doesnot work for change less than 50
         as change takes -ve value and the loop is ended
         without giving change

12.  A program is used to change Octal to decimal. If n is
     no of digits and are entered into the program. The digits
     are entered from minimum to maximum.

    dec = (exp)
    end do
 what is the expression to be written?

  ans:  dec = dec+(8**(i-1)*oct)

13.  The logic below is bound to go into endless loop for some
     compilers, state the reason?
    
     do(x<=4.0)
     printf("%d%c",x,sin(x))
     x = x+0.1
     end do

     ans: X should be in radians,x cannot take other than -phi to 
phi
     therefor for x>3.14 will hang for some compilers.

14.  The program given below is to print the radius and area
     of a circle.  For large values of n, the execution is found 
     to take long time. State reasons? How do you reduce the time
     of execution.
     int r,n
     do
     pi=3.14159
     else
     .
.    .    
     .
     ans:  Assignments can be done outside.

         as change takes -ve value and the loop is ended
         without giving change

12.  A program is used to change Octal to decimal. If n is
     no of digits and are entered into the program. The digits
     are entered from minimum to maximum.

    int oct;
    dec=0;
    do i=1 to n
    input=oct;
    dec = (exp)
    end do
 what is the expression to be written?

  ans:  dec = dec+(8**(i-1)*oct)

13.  The logic below is bound to go into endless loop for some
     compilers, state the reason?
    
     do(x<=4.0)
     printf("%d%c",x,sin(x))
     x = x+0.1
     end do

     ans: X sho
