-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Data Structures:
 1. which sort of the foll is O(nlog(n)) in both avg , worst case...
    a. selection b. quick c. insertion d.merge
 2. we have a hash table of 11 size and the foll positions are filled 
    0,1,2,4,5,9,10 . for an nsuccessful search ( for an elmt which is not in table)
    atmost how many queries u need ?
    a. 1 b.2 c.4 d.6
 3. If you have two linked list & you want to fin dthe union of the two lists which of the following methods is good.
	a. Copy one list & 
 4. Find the shortest path given an Adjacency matrix.

Programming
 1. Consider the foolowing code

	for(i = 0; i < N; i ++)
		for(j = i; j < N; i++)
			A[i] = A[j];

	How many times the assignment has been done.

	a. N		b. N^2/2	c. (N^2 - N)/2		d. N^2 - N

 2. int (*(*ptr)(int))(void);
	What is ptr (define it)?

 3. 	fun(int x, int n)
	{
		value = 1;
		if(n%2) value *= x;
		value = value + fun(x*x, n/2);
		return(value);
	}
	find the value fun(4, 9).
	a. 36		b. 13		c. etc ......

 4. 
	fun(int A, int B)
	{
		if(B == 0) return 0;
		if(A < B) return 1;
		else
			return (fun(A - 1, B) + fun(A - B, B - 1));
	}
	find fun(5, 2) (it seems :-))

5. The foll. code is to implement the string Concatenate for two strings using strcat

	char *Concatenate(char *s1, char *s2)
	{
		char buff[1000];
		buff[0] = '\0';
		strcat(buff, s1);
		strcat(buff, s2);
		return(buff);
	}

	1. It won't work if the length of the concatenated string exceeeds 1000 chars.
	2. Should not return pointer to local variables.
	3. Code doesn't work.
	4. Nothing wrong in the function.

	Which of the above is/are correct .
	a. 1&2 etc ..............

Operating Systems
 1. One ques on finding the number of page faults(implemented using LRU)

 2. A cache access takes 100ns & a memory access takes 1200 ns. What should be the hit 
ratio of the cache, if the avg. access should be at most 20% extra than cache access.
	a. 80%		b. 90%		c. 98%		d. 99%

 3.Match the foll.
   
   critical section 		
-  circular wait
   dead lock			-  Harore's algo 
   mutual exclusion		-  
   wait/signal			-

General
 1. What is the prob. of finding a number between 100 to 999 which doesn't contain a
    digit 7
	a. 9/10		b. 16/25	c. 18/25	d. 729/1000

 2. Find the prefix & postfix notation for a given infix expression
	(a + b - c) * (e / f) - ( g - h/i)

 3. A code having letters a,b,c,d,e,f with given  freq.(i don't remember)
  of strings with length 1,3,3,3,3,4,4. 
   How many bits are saved using this decoding ?
 
Theory
 1. Mapping is given below.
	S --> 1S1
	S --> 11
	S --> 0S0
	S --> 00

  Which of the following sequence match the mapping
	Some binary sequences were given like 1011 etc.

 2. which of the foll.  is true
    a. (a and b) -> (b or c)
    b. (a ->b) -> (b->a)
    c. 

 3.


 
II Subjective

	1. Write a function to clone a DAG, which has the node defined by the foll. structure.

	typedef struct Emuls
	{
		int value;
		int N;		//outdegree 
		NodePtr children[100];	// Children
	}Node, *NodePtr, *GraphPtr;

	Write a function GraphPtr Clone(GraphPtr G) where G root of the DAG. It should have one to one mapping.
	2. Write a C function to find a sub-rectangle which has maximum sum of its 
	elements, given a rectangle A[M][N].
