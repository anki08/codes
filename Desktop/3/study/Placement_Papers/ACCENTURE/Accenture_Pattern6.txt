Subject: [CHETANA] (Pattern) Accenture

Hi all,

Many people are asking about the accenture qn
pattern....So here are some details...

The written test on java is very simple and definitly
u can get thro if u have basic idea about java.
only 2 to 3 questions in EJB rest all from core java
and servlets and JSP.

The GD was about "worm in Cadburys chocolate....who
was at fault??" ....u need not worry here also if u
have basic communication skill....... but dont fight
in GD.... if someone interuppts just listen to him/
her and then place ur point across.

HR interview is just to know ur intention and what
idea u have about accenture.

Technical round, i was asked about the difference
between sendredirect and forward. Then about iplanet
server. Also 2 to 3 basic questions thats all.

[There is no specific order for HR or Technical round
...all depends on the availability of interviewrs]

All the best ..

regards,
Vasu
