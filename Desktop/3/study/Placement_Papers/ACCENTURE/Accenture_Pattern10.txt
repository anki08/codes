Subject: [CHETANA] (Pattern+Query) Accenture(rounds-3&4)


hi friends

i gave the exam of accenture on 10th Jan.

ROUND I
the test was for 1 hr duration with three sections
60 questions in all--- no negative marking

1) Quant: Rs Agarwal
2) English:reading passage, synonyms etc.
3) Logical Reasoning

The paper was easy and the cut off was very less ... i heard it was 25 
questions from 60 (not confirmed)

ROUND II
This was the GD round

group of 12 people--topic: Indo-Pak relations, Is america bullyingother 
countries etc
To clear this round u just have to speak.. that's it... make urself heard in 
the group..what u speak is not important....

they said the Round III will be an HR round which will conducted over a 
telephone and the
ROUND IV is the Tech round which will be conducted though video 
conferencing...

Can n e one plz tell what to expect in the 3rd and the 4th round ... what do 
they look for in the candidate in these rounds as each round is an 
elimination round.....


looking 4 your help

thanks

regards

gautam
