	Company name: Wipro Infotech Ltd., Bangalore.
	Year: 1995

Wipinfo has 2 rounds of interviews. The first round is fully technical.
The second round, depending on the members of the board, may be
technical,
semi-technical or personal. Last year the second round was more
technical than the first(!) and the board was headed by Mr. P.V.Sanjeeva
Reddy, one of the no-nonsense, hardcore-technical, project leaders
in Infotech. This year it was headed by Mr. Victor Jayakiran, G.M.
(Technical, Global R&D) who was a much sober man and therefore spent
most of the time in the second round dealing with personal questions.

I detail here the technical questions asked in the first round --
--------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Tell us about your work in brief.
My Ans. Mention first the title, followed by a brief overview of the
work, what we plan to achieve, what has been achieved so far, finally
the relevance/scope of the work to the related area (i.e. how is it
going to be useful).	[ 5-10 mins. depending on interest of the
listener.]

[2..n] Questions related to the work.
Ans. Area dependent. [ ~ 10 mins ]

[n+1] Tell us what you know about DMA and why that is needed?
My Ans. As usual, mentioned the wastage of CPU computation power spent
in busy-waiting. Told how DMA works.

[n+2] What are the various types of scheduling algo, what is used by
UNIX?
My Ans. Mentioned Round Robin, First-come-first-served,
Shortest-job-first, Earliest-deadline-first, Least-laxity-first,
Priority-based-event-driven. UNIX uses RR with multi-level feedback.

[n+3] How can you implement SJF in UNIX?
My Ans. Usually, SJF means that we know the job-duration in advance. In
UNIX where we cannot know that, we have to make assumptions about that
based on which we should initially schedule. Periodically however, we
have to fine-tune our initial assumptions based on the times taken by
various ready jobs, and recompute estimates and change the schedule
accordingly.

[n+4] Different types of subroutine calling conventions?
My Ans. Call by value, reference, value-result.

[n+5] Parameter passing sequence used by C?
My Ans. Rightmost parameter pushed first on stack.

[n+6] What is a page-fault and how is it handled in UNIX?
My Ans. [Refer to MJBach, Ch. 9 for details].

Personal questions in the first round --
-------------------------------------

1. What was your overall position in the Univ. in B.E.
2. Why did you choose to join MS here.
3. How do you like the MS course.
4. Anything you want to know about us.

Technical Questions in the second round --
---------------------------------------

[1] What are the current trends and areas of focus in IT.
My Ans. Talked about emerging trends of S/W Engg and ISO 9000 stuff
(gave vague ideas about them as I don't know much nor do I care 
about these topics myself ;-)). Then mentioned the proliferation of O-O
methodologies and their usefulness in speeding up development process,
code re-usability, ease of maintenance, ease of bug-fixing.
Thirdly, mentioned the work going on in High-Speed N/w - FDDI, ATM,
Fast-Ethernet(100Mbps). Told whatever little I knew about ATM in
response to another question.

[2] What is a Micro-Kernel architecture.
My Ans. This is a developing area in OSs where  instead of building the
kernel as a single monolithic structure starting from scratch, it is
built as a set of layers. The micro-kernel provides only the bare-bones
like Device-drivers, rudimentary filesystem support etc. on which,
depending on the intended area of application of the OS, it can be
customized to provide various higher level OS features like
Multiprocessing, IPC, etc. 

Personal Questions in the second round --
--------------------------------------

1. Tell us about yourself, your background.
2. What does your father do currently.
3. Your performance in schooling, B.E.
4. Your +/- points.
5. Why do you think Wipro should take you.
6. What qualities do you have that make you a person suitable for going
into the IT industry (a corollary to the previous question).
7. What do your friends opine about you.
8. When do you think you will complete and be able to join.
9. How can you assure that you will join by that time.
10. Anything you want to know about us.

Name: G.Kartik
Year: 1995

Company name: Wipro Infotech

   FIRST INTERVIEW:(First the interviewer asked me to name two 
                    favorite subjects - OS and Networks)
   a) Describe the memory management policies in Unix. How is paging
      implemented? How page faults are handled? 
      Seems to be a favorite question for these chaps ---- Maurice Bach. 
   
   b) Write a macro in C for swapping two nibbles in a byte.
      -Use the shift operators and be careful while defining temporary 
      variables( if you do so) as you have to write a macro. Otherwise
      it is pretty simple.

   c) What is the CPU-scheduling policy in Unix? - Round robin scheduling
      with multilevel queues.

   d) Diffrence between short term, long term and medium term scheduler.
      -First two should be peaceful. The last one is also known as 
       swapper. (See Taenenbaum and/or Peterson)

   e) Name various page-replacement policies. Which can be implemented
      both with and without pre-emption? - see Peterson.

   f) Describe the Sliding window protocol. What is it's advantage
      over stop-and-wait? - Saves bandwidth. (Taenenbaum please)


   2ND INTERVIEW (Both personal and technical interleaved)
   a) Tell us something about yourself.
   b) Aren't you going for higher studies abroad? Why?
   c) Rank and CGPA. MSites do not have ranks but still they wanted to
      know my approx position in my batch. 
      - Shady question. It is your job to convince them that for
      MS, grades do not hold any meaning.

   d) What is re-entrant code? --- Non-self modifying code. Can be 
      shared by many processes simultaneously. Gave e.g. of text-editors
      like 'vi'.
      Counter Q: But then no code modifies itself. What does 'non-self 
      modifying' mean? ---- I don't know for sure.

   e) Diff between compilers and interpreters. Some fundaes about
      how to link code in  different files. 

   f) What would your friends tell us about you if we ask them?
      Standard question for everyone.



Company: Motorola (came in August'95)
Just one question: When do you expect to finish? ---By August'96
                   That is too late. We are looking for guys who
                   finish by Jan'96. Pl. apply a month before you 
                   submit your thesis. Thank you very much.


Company: HCL-HP
Written test:
One GRE type anals. section, and two comp Sc. sections. One Comp Sc. 
section was problem solving type. Quite easy. Only question worth mentioning
in it was:
    You are given a stack on which you can do the following:

    Push X ----push the contents of memory location X on the stack
    Pop X  ----pop the contents of top of stack into mem. loc X
    AND    ----pop top two elements of stack, AND them and push the
               result onto stack.
    NOR    ----pop top two elements, NOR them and push the result onto stack.

Given two data elements at memory locations A and B, obtain A XOR B using 
the above.

First Interview:- mostly technical.

	a) Asked about my B.E. and why I joined MS.

	
b) My preference of posting. They asked this initially before
	   launching into any other questions. I told them Madras.
	   Remainder of the interview was mostly on OS and C. Nothing
	   on networks. Thus I have this inkling that they frame their 
	   questions on the basis of what you specify as your preference 
	   of posting and  depending on what projects are available there.


	c) What architectures, apart from 8085, do you know? --- Nothing 
	   very deep and I told them as much.


	d) Give the contents of process stack for the execution of 
	   a particular C-program they give. 
	   ------ The C-program as such is not important. You just have 
	   to remember the order in which the return address of any 
	   function/procedure call, the parameters, and the local variables
	   are stored on the stack. 
	   ( I guess, any CO book should have this. Maurice Bach talks 
	   about user and kernel stacks)

	e) What all are shared by parent and child processes immediately
	   after parent executes a fork system call? Cross questioned
	   about the 'copy on write' facility and 'dup' system call. 
	   --- again see MB, and also Stevens' 2nd chapter.

	f) What events happen when the following command is given?
		cat /etc/passwd | more 

	   ---- Describe how the shell forks the two processes and how
		the pipe gets created between them. 
	  Cross question: How does 'cat' know that its output has to be 
	                  written into the pipe and not into standard o/p?
	
 

	g) Have you written any TSR's? --- No.
	   What are TSR? ----Terminate but stay resident programs.
	   Then does it mean DOS is a multitasking system? 
	   ---- No, TSRs are interrupt driven

	h) How are Windows programs different from normal C-programs?
	   ---- Windows programs are event driven.
	   What can be the various types of events? --- See Primer/API bible.

	i) Difference between swapping and paging. 
	   ---- Swapping is moving entire processes between main memory
	   and hard disk. Paging is moving individual pages of a process.
	   
	j) Write a program to list all palindromes in a string.
	   ----- Hint: use a stack and some extra storage for remembering
	   previous palindromes.

	k) What's the outout?

		char *cp;
		int *ip;

		cp=(char *)0x100;
		ip=(int *)cp;

		ip++;
		cp++;
		printf("cp = %x ip = %x", cp, ip);

		Ans:cp = 0x101 ip = 0x102 ...(why?)

	l) What are static variables and functions? There are two files,
	   say, file1 and file2. file1 has a global declaration
			static int x;
	  file2 has a global declaration
			int y;
	  What is the difference between the two types of declarations
	  when you link file1 and file2? 
	  --- x is local to functions in file1 and cannot be seen by  
	      functions in file2. y can be seen by functions in both 
	      file1 and file2.

	m) How does a debugger set breakpoints in a code you are debugging?
	   ---- some funda regarding insertion if an interrupt instruction
	        in the code....don't know for sure.
	  (It seems that this q was also asked by some other company.
	   Worth knowing the answer.)

This was followed by a shady psychological test. You are given a 
set of six pictures. Look at each picture and write a story on each.

Second interview: (fully personal) --- This was more interesting;-)
	a) What did you feel about the ppt? --- wasn't very impressive
	  so gave some shady answer.
	b) Have you heard of creativity? -- Ya.
	   Have you heard of Bernard Shaw? -- Ya.
	   (Then he rattled off some quote of BS regarding creativity)
	   What do you say? --- I put some shadiest fundaes regarding
	   visionaries and Leonardo da Vinci conceptualising Helicopters
	   in his time!

************************************************************************
NOTE: If you have been offered a job previously by any other company
      after your BTech/BE or if you have even slightest of work experience
      then make it a point to mention about it.  It is a major plus point.
      The interviewers will be definitely interested in knowing that some 
      other company also found you good enough to be selected.

**********************************************************************

U.V.Ravindra - D.J.Ram's student. Passed out in Jan '95.
**********************************************************************

The first thing any IIT-ian should realize while attending Campus
Interviews is that the Companies have come to take you, and that
*you* are not looking for a job.  I refer to the attitude of the mind.
Therefore, there's no need to treat it as a life and death issue.  In
my opinion, several students take this matter as a very serious career
issue, and think that if they don't get a job in the campus
interviews, they are sunk.  This is not true.  A good case in point
will be Sudhakar's, who didn't get any job that he wanted in the
Campus Interviews, but when he came to Bangalore and applied to the
different companies, he landed a job in *every* company he applied
for.  And these companies were by no means insignificant ones: Tata
Elxsi, Wipro Infotech, Novell, C-DAC ... all those which are
considered to be respectable employers.  So, the catch phrase during
Campus Interviews is, "don't panic, be cool, relax, you have *nothing*
to lose, and everything to gain."  This is the attitude you should
have in mind when you go for the interviews.

About the companies, now.  There are mainly two kinds of companies in
Bangalore.  Those that are small, like Tata Elxsi and Novell, with a
more or less flat organizational structure, and those that are very
huge, like Wipro and TISL, where there's a veritable population
explosion.  There are merits and demerits of both.  In the small
organizations, there are fewer people, so it is easy to make your
presence felt and to make yourself noticed, and to get proper credit
for what you are doing.  The flip side of the coin for these
organizations is that you have to be very careful in what you say and
do, for everything you do/say is audible at the highest levels, and,
as the American Police say when they are arresting a criminal
"anything you say may be used against you."  Smaller organizations
also have a flatter structure, so the amount of responsibility on your
shoulders may be quite heavy.  In one sense it is good -- you can
contribute well to the organization and get credit for it, but in
another sense it is bad, for you may have to work late and quite hard
too.  The advantages of being in a large organization like Wipro is
that you will never be *overloaded* with work, unless you choose to do
so yourself.  You can be in the company as you are in the CS
Department right now, light-headed and carefree, even a bit careless.
The obverse side of the coin here is that in such huge organizations,
you will never be anything but small fry in a big pond ... and getting
credit where it is due may be a little difficult (specific reference
to TISL here).

Another issue that should be considered when seriously aiming at a
company is the nature of the job that you will be put in.  In my
honest opinion, since the pay structures of most companies are
verisimilar now, and the salary differential between employees of
different companies is very minimal, the nature of work is the most
important criterion that one should pay attention to.  If you are
specifically interested in some kinds of jobs, such as, say UNIX
Internals/Device Drivers, Networking (Unix/DOS), or graphics,
multimedia, etc, you should aim at companies that are primarily
working in those areas.  Also, you should try to find out, through
other channels, as to whether openings exist in those companies for
the kind of job that you are aiming at.  For example, Wipro Infotech's
communication group has no openings right now.  Most people who join
Wipinfo are taken into the Testing/Debugging groups, or put in the
Tandem Group.  These are pretty low down in the job priority order of
the average computer professional in Bangalore.  Novell is working in
DOS based networking (Netware) and is by far one of the best companies
in Bangalore -- good salary, flat structure, nice working environment.
Tata Elxsi is also working in Networking, but that is mainly UNIX
based.  Other companies that work in Unix are TISL and Wipro Systems.
Device drivers and Unix Internals are a big word in WipSys, Wipinfo
and Elxsi.  There are other companies like Siemens Information Systems
Ltd., Siemens Computing Services Ltd., which I am not sure of.  Texas
Instruments is working VLSI CAD and chip design stuff.  Motorola,
can't say.  Other companies working in Unix Internals and Networking
are Hughes and HCL HP.  Also, some companies in Delhi are there ...

That's about companies.  Now about the interview.  A typical interview
panel will have one to two people from the technical cadres and a
couple (or more) of chaps from the Human Resources division.  The
technical guys are usually interested in grilling you on an area that
you choose -- typically they ask you what areas are your favourites
and then ask you questions in that.  This happens in companies like
C-DAC, Wipro, Elxsi etc.  In  addition, they might ask you, if you say
you like working in Unix, to select one particular area of the OS and
ask you fundaes in that.  Therefore, prepare for all this kind of
thing.  Read up the C-FAQ and the UNIX FAQ.  Be prepared for dumb
questions in recursion in C and, if you know C++, some questions on
Inheritance etc.  About UNIX, try to concentrate on some topic like
IPC etc.  Otherwise, device drivers etc would be fine.  Also, if you
are planning to suggest networking as an area of interest, be clear
about what the various layers of the TCP/IP stack do, where they fit
in with respect to the OSI protocol layers, and also internals of the
TCP or IP processes in the kernel.  If you are preparing for the
Novell interview, there is no harm in saying that you don't know
anything about Netware, but you have only heard about it.  However,
say that you have good basics in TCP/IP networking, and be prepared to
prove your statement.

Another thing you should be prepared with is how to give an overview
of your project/thesis topic in two-three minutes.  This is the
typical attention span of the people who interview you, and it is
better to try and fit in as much info as you can into the first two
minutes of your talk about your project/thesis topic.  Also, try to
make it as interesting as possible, and leave a few loose ends if you
want them to ask you some questions on that, so that you can
demonstrate your mastery over the subject.

I really can't think of many more things to write.  Perhaps I would
have said more if I were giving you people a talk or something like
that.  It is more interactive that way, and more issues crop up.  Tell
me if I can be of any more help.  Do mail back.

Regards,
Ravindra.

Hi Srichie (and others),

My boss is on leave today, and I just finished my work slightly ahead
of schedule, so here are some answers to your questions.  Find them
ensconced comfortably amongst the questions themselves.  For your
convenience, I have prepended a '===>' string to each of my responses.

===> Well, first of all, you, Srichie, at least, don't seem to have
learnt anything from my earlier mail.  Learn from this one, therefore.
Learn that these companies are *not* _DESTINED to be your DESTINY_
... you have the choice to make as to which one *you* want.  Learn to
remember, always, and never forget, that the companies are coming to
*take* you; *you* aren't dying to join them.  Learn that, it is *you*
and not the companies who are in the commanding position.  Learn that
you aren't in the proverbial beggar's position: you *can* choose.
Learn that you *should, must, have to, ought to* choose.

===> The *PLEASE!!!!!* stinks thoroughly of insecurity.  Please
abolish that thought from your mind forthwith!

And finally, before I go on, be warned that this is a
Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong
mail, and be prepared to spend some time with boring details of
companies.

All the best to all of you in all your endeavours,

> 01. BEL, Ba. ===> Can't say anything about it, though it's about 20
min. walk from my house.  I suppose they mostly deal with VLSI CAD and
stuff like that, which deals directly with Electronics.

> 02. CMC, Hy.	===> Ask J. Sriram ;-) :)  He will by far be the best
information provider.

> 03. Cadence Design Sys, Noida. (*)

===>

A company that deals extensively with VLSI CAD.  Amongst the highest
payers in the job market today.  When they came last year they offered
(me!) 1.75 lakh per annum.  I, of course, spurned the offer.  The kind
of money they offer will be good for anybody, even if they live in an
expensive place like Delhi, where it is situated.  If you are
interested in doing a job with *no* work (I do mean you will have to
sit idle), which purportedly deals with VLSI CAD, join this company.
They were really desperate for people last year:  I had given in my
application, but had decided against joining the company, so I
abstained from the interview.  They *rang me up at the SUNLab* to ask
whether I would attend the interview, please.  To which, of course, I
answered in the negative, thank you.  

If you join this company, be prepared to meet a lot of louts from
Delhi College of Engineering and/or Delhi Institute of Technology,

I don't know if this is another one of those
*workless* (worthless!) front-ends for a big body-shopping
multinational, but from what I hear from the Pune-ites here, it isn't.
That means it isn't a body-shopper, most probably; no comments about
worthless :) or not.

A big one for Graphics.  The only challenger to Silicon Graphics Inc.,
the most powerful Graphics company in India (and the world) yet.

Disadvantage: Location.  Pune is *not* a part of India's silicon
valley.  Believe me, it places employees at a considerable
disadvantage.

> 05. DENEB Hitech, Ba. (*) ===>  Absolutely no idea about this one.
Will try to find out, but can't assure anything.

> 06. DBSS, Md.  ===>  Never heard of this one either.

> 07. Frontier Info Tech, Hy. (*)  ===> Am I deaf/blind, or are new
companies cropping up in "satellite silicon vallies" (hey! I hold the
copyright for that phrase) like Hyderabad, Madras, Pune, etc?  I've
never heard of this one either.

> 08. Geometric S/w Services, Bo. (*)  ===> Boy!  I *am* in the wrong
room, aren't I?  So many new and strange companies ...

> 09. Hughes S/w Sys, ND.

===> Ask our resident dark-horse Unit Sirsiwal for details on this
one.  Also ask him *why* he left the company.  My other friends in
Hughes seem to be quite satisfied with it.  One of them (my classmate
in BTech) worked there for two years.  He booked a Maruti 800, which
is due for delivery in Feb '96; they sent him to US immediately! ;-)

> 10. IMRL, Ba. (*)  ===>  Sounds like one of those quasi-governmental
organizations like C-DAC, C-DOT, BEL etc.  Can't say if it *is* one of
them or not, for this is the first I have heard of it.

> 11. IMI S/w, Hy. (Dunno expansion of IMI) (*)

===>  Neither do I :-(  Looks like I'm in the wrong party now.  I'll
have to stop and ask for directions.

> 12. INFOSYS, Ba. ===>  The best company for non-CS people who want
to make an entry into Software jobs.  A cousin of the dreaded TCS.
Better than TCS.  A "no-no" for all CS BTech/upwards degree holders.
Give it a clear berth (this is for all MS/PhD scholars).  For the
others: prepare well for the test.  Flunk the interview.  They will
select you.  

For details about the test, ask Ravan.

> 13. Info Tech Ltd, Faridabad. (*) ===> Faridabad is a factory area,
close to Delhi, in Haryana (for all practical purposes, it can be said
to be the Industrial Suburb of New Delhi).  I've never heard of this
company, and it might be a good idea to check up on this before even
attending the PPTalk.

> 14. L&T, Bo.	===>  A couple of my friends joined here after BTech.
I lost all touch with them promptly.  Either L&T ate them for
lunch/dinner, or they have just joined the ranks of those
multitudinous Bombayites, for whom the world outside doesn't exist.
They used to manufacture PCs.  I don't know what they do now.

In any case, L&T would be working in Manufacturing CAD, if I am not
mistaken.  Try it, if you are interested in MfCAD.   The pay may be
*good*, not *excellent* and by no means *stupendous*.

One thing about L&T.  They hold the worldwide patents for the
"zee-pump" ... the "Z"-shaped pump that you see at the petrol bunks in
Adyar and the one near Malar Hospital.  A great achievement.  Another
thing about L&T.  The person who headed the zee-pump project, a guy by
the name of Chakravarti, has quit.  He now rests in comfortable
obscurity in the cosy arms of IIT Delhi, in his position as Assistant
Professor, Mech. Engg. Department.

> 15. MIEL, Ba.	===>  Sorry, can't provide data on this.  They're too
secretive about what they do. :-) :-)

But seriously, they work in cellular telephones and pagers and stuff
like that.  Could be good work, but I don't know.  A good job for CS
MTechs with an Electronics background.  At any rate, they're going to
prefer ECE MTechs and MSs to CS chaps.  Try nonetheless.

They pay a little less than Wipro Infotech, where the take home ranges
close to 9k pm.

One positive point about a Motorola job is that they offer leased
accommodation in Bangalore.  Believe me, it's a very tangible benefit.
They also don't seem to have any restriction on how many laser
printouts are taken (and *what* printouts are taken) by employees.  I
have seen people downloading pictures of Madhubala and Meena Kumari
and taking laser printouts of them.

Of course, you can do that in Wipro Infotech too, provided you are in
the AT&T bug fixing project.

> 16. NEXUS, Pondicherry. (*)  ===> Pshoo!  I thought people of
Pondicherry were a more spiritual lot!  Aurobindo and all that.
Remember our trip to that place? 

Can't help feeling that I've lost myself in the woods somewhere.  Have
to yell for help ... there's a wicked wolf gazing hungrily in my
direction ... grandmaa .... help!!!

> 17. Netquest, Ba.

===> A company started by IBM/Microsoft defectors (dunno which one
exactly).  It's said to have a good work culture, but can't say much
about it.  It was established sometime last year.  DOS work.  I don't
have much respect for DOS (indeed, I hold it in the utmost contempt).
Therefore, I will desist from saying anything more about it, lest I
should colour your mind with my biased opinions.

> 18. Novell S/w Dev, Ba.

===> From what Sudhakar tells me, it seems to be a good company.
However, they work mostly in DOS-based (NETWARE) networks.  As far as
networks is concerned, a company worth putting in the Dream Job list.
As far as Unix is concerned, they don't have much work going on.  The
Unixware guys are treated as some sort of poor cousins of the NetWare
guys, I am told.  The pay and perks are good.  Based on
employee-employer trust, so you can get away with a lot of fraudulence
in the name of overtime, house-shifting ... etc.

Ask Sudhakar for more details.  I'm sure he will supply enough to make
your mouth water, and your pens to rush for the dream job form.

> 19. ORACLE Corp, Ba.

===>  THIS IS THE BEST PAYER IN BANGALORE TODAY!!!!

Yes.  And Sanjay Patil, who was porting Oracle to SCO-Unix has already
gone to US!  A good company, but only if you are willing to condemn
yourself to working in Oracle all your life.  They work in all aspects
of Oracle, right from the internals (file system, concurrency control,
etc) to the User Interface.  Quite a lot of their work is bug fixing
and stuff, but some lucky fellows might get to do a bit of porting
from one OS to another, which isn't as bad as it sounds, actually.

> 20. Ramco Sys, Md.	===> Ask somebody else.  I never thought that
companies in Madras were worth joining, and, consequently, never
bothered about them.

> 21. River Run S/w(formerly Comsoft), Noida.

===> Said to be working in Networks.  Someone should have asked
Shalini Agrawal what she does apart from sending mails to her friends
in Cadence etc.  Perhaps someone from Sarayu already did that when she
(Shalini A.) came for the Convo.

Said to pay decently.  Which means nothing, because, being in Delhi,
you'll still be away from the heart and soul of the computer industry,
Bangalore. 

BTW, my home is in Delhi, and, since I *chose* to work in Bangalore, I
must know what I am talking about! :-)

> 22. Siemens Commn S/w, Ba.
> 23. Siemens Info Ltd, Ba.
> 24. SIEMENS Ltd, ND.

===>
All three are good companies.  I have already detailed all these in my
earlier mail.  They work in communications.

> 25. Sonic S/w Sys, Hy. (*)

===>
A company working in Systems and Networking.

> 26. TCS, Bo. 

===> The avoidable giant!

> 27. TI, Ba

===>  The only other company working in the same field as Cadence
above.  All I said for Cadence holds good for it, except that the pay
is slightly lower.  The perks are good, working conditions excellent,
etc.  Attend the PPT.

> 28. TISL, Ba. 

===> A cousin to my own organization, Tata Elxsi.  The TATA Stamp, and
so called IBM culture.  Can't say anything much.  The pay is amongst
the highest in the Industry.  It is actually a big bodyshopper.

> 29. VSNL, Bo.

===> The Government's only value-added network service provider
company.  The pay may not be too good, considering you will be placed
in Bombay, and you might become on of the nondescript millions who
shuttle between one end of Bombay to the other in the dreaded local
trains.  There may be certain perks that I don't know of.  The
interviewers are bound to be knowledgeable, and from NCST, Bombay.
Perhaps Dr. Ramani, the virtual head of the ERNET project may come.  A
job whose interview I can predict will be interesting to attend.  I
can't say much about the job itself, for I am not sure about it at
all.

> 30. WIPRO INFOTECH Ltd. }
> 	   &            } Ba.
>       WIPRO SYSTEMS     } 

I don't think there's anything to be said about these giants.  Only
thing is, Wipro is not into the holidays business.  I firmly believe
that joining Wipro will further your student-like life for a few more
years, and if you are really raring to get into the corporate line of
jobs, then Wipro is not for you.  When I say Wipro above, I mean
Infotech.  Wipro Systems is one of the more Pseud-ish companies, what
with their formal attire, replete with Tie and associated
appurtenances of a western lifestyle.  Both Wipro-s have a very good
pay, and *sure-shot* revisions once a year, where you do end up
getting at least a 20% hike, usually.  Don't quote me, however. This
is strictly off the records.

> 31. Fujitsu Optel Ltd, Bhopal. (*)

Search me!

> Love,
> Srichie.

Thanks for your time.  Kudos for lasting this far through my sickly
humour! :)

Best Wishes,
Ravindra.


Hi guys and gals,

It must be time for the Campus Placement Interviews, judging from the
multitudes of mails that I receive about this topic.  As I throw my
mind back to when *I* was preparing to attend my Campus Interviews, I
recall that one important question we were all faced with was "which
company do I name as my dream job company?"

Here are some simple rules of thumb which you can use to decide which
company to give as your dream job, but first, remember to FILL IN BOTH
ENTRIES.

The dream job system in our IIT is organized such that 
	a) you can attend any number of interviews till you get a job,
after which you can not attend any more interviews other than that for
the dream job.
	b) if the first job you got was your dream job, you can't
attend any more interviews.
	c) if you have a non-dream job, and you flunk your "first"
dream job interview, you can't attend the second "dream job"
interview.
	d) if you don't get any job, you can go on attending
interviews till you get sick of them.

IMO, the problem with the dream jobs arises only because of the "you
can't attend any more interviews" clause. 

Hence, for your dream job, select a company 

1) which you will be willing to join, if you get it.
2) whose interview dates are among the last (in Dec/Jan)
3) which, in case you don't get it, won't make you feel like it is the
end of the world.

This means that you should never give as your dream job a company
which is actually your dream.  For example, if you dream is Wipro,
it's better not to give it as you dream job, because it fails in all
the criteria mentioned above.  

Please take the recommendations given above as *my* opinions, and
weigh them wisely before accepting them as your own.  I am *NOT* to be
blamed for any unfortunate turn of events that befalls you out of your
following any of my advice :-)))

Wishing you all the best,
Ravindra.

***********************************************************************

	About the job opportunities for you, dont worry, there are plenty. If
you are not tied to B'lore then you have got even more opportunities,
especially
in Delhi. In B'lore there are good firms like, Tata-IBM (TISL), 
Hewlett-Packard (HP), Wipro Infotech, Novell, etc. Recently Wipro is
taking hajaar people. These companies in the general field, undertaking projects
in a variety of fields. There certain specialist firms like, Wipro GE (Medical
systems), Tata Unisys (RDBMS), Texas Instruments (Chip designing, tools for 
CAD), Verifone (Transaction automation), Siemens Commn systems (communication)
etc. If u are not so much bothered a about the nature of work, the best company
available is Texas Instruments, the most well established multinational in 
Bangalore, which is also the first to come here. In Delhi there are two 
companies whose main area is Networks - Hughes Network systems, and River Run 
(Old name CompSoft). These people pay very heavily. The only minus point is 
that it is in Delhi.

	Dont be bothered too much of the interviews. Of course, if you can 
familiarize with unix internals, then it is an added advantage. In the
case of some companies, there will be
written test (aptitude, reasoning, etc.) before the interview. If u can get
thru the written test with a good performance, chances are high that u may be
selected. I dont recommend C-DAC, as pay is very less now, compared to private
firms. Never join any govt firm. 

With best wishes...
pradeep

Hi Everybody,
	These questions were e-mailed to me by Tom (MS
	scholar). It suddenly reminded me of how little
	information we had about companies when we
	appeared for the campus interviews - and also about
	how much we cursed our seniors for not having sent
	any. So ... in case you have already cursed .. better
	take them back ... for here comes some info about
	TEIL (Tata Elxsi India Ltd.)...

> 1- Your exact pay (take home & gross) 
	(7500 + 950 + 500)

> 2- Acco-scene in Bangalore ??
	Note : The company does not give any acco for the
	first few days. (This, I think is the ONLY drawback
	of TEIL).

	Generally what happens with every guy (and which
	also happened to me) is that the chap madly searches 
	for an acco for the first 15-20 days. 

	He then gets damn pissed off and is on the verge of
	giving off - when lo !! - he finds a real good
	apartment. The funda is that the brokers show the 
	unwanted and shady houses for the first 15-20 days 
	hoping that you will get despo enough to go for them.
	Keep on refusing them and at end they will show you
	the right one.

	As for gals ... I dont know much about their acco. 
	I dont know how they manage it, but they always get 
	PG, rented house accos, etc. much more easily than 
	guys. God knows how ???

	But generally one can forget of living alone, since
	the cost of a proper apartment is around 2500-3500.

> 3- Does the company have a canteen or mess where you can have your
>    meals from? (No don't laugh, I don't relish the prospect of cooking)
	The lunch is provided by one reasonable good `Nourish
	Caterer'. Biscuit, Coffee, Tea is provided - on the
	house. Maagi noodles or bread-omlette is also
	available in the kitchen at proper cost.

> 4- Transport ??
	Van/Bus leave from HO, Richmond Road (centre of city,
	for those who dont know {PUB-CITY-}Bangalore - YET !!) to
	Whitefield at :
		7:00 am
		8:15 am
		9:30 am
		12:15 pm
		2:45 pm

	From Whitefield to HO at :
		9:40 am
		11:10 am
		4:30 pm
		6:15 pm
		8:30 pm
		10:00 pm
	Personally I dont think that the location of office
	in Whitefield (out of Bangalore city) is a big
	problem. The company provides transport as listed
	above which is good enough. Only problem is that one
	cant have a break from the office-work by looking at the MG
	Road girls!!! In fact I love the location since it
	saves me the daily ordeal in BTS (Bangalore Transport Service)
	buses.

> 5- 1 or 2 lines about each of the major projects currently being
>    undertaken by Tata Elxsi.
	Client-driven projects : 
	NETLABS :
	Maintenance of a s/w called  DIAMONDS (an SNMP
	service provider). Some design-work has also been
	alloted to TEIL offlate.

	ANALOG DEVICES :
	Vedio Telephony project consists of design and
	development of a vedio telephony system using ADSP
	chips of Analog.

	Medical Imaging System (in collaboration with the
	Singapore University). I heard that a lot of porting
	work goes on in this project. A lot of GUI fundaes
	is also used here.

	Some other new project from the defence orgn.s are
	also being carried out. I donno what exactly.

> 6- Chances of going abroad. 
	The rest of the lot, i.e. those who are not working
	there pretty behind off in the client-driven
	projects, form expertise development teams. There
	are teams in Image Processing, SNMP, ISDN (of which
	I am a part). We try to do in-house projects and get
	our fundaes clear (which we should have done in
	college - long time back !!!).

	Dont you turn your nose in the other direction on
	hearing the words `in-house projects'. Altho these
	projects are not client-driven, they offer much
	better scope of learning in many cases. Also in case
	of any new project which includes overseas requirements 
	(also known as body-shopping) there is a good chance 
	that these people will be sent.

> 7- Any tips on how to get through the interview?
	Dont thro away other books, but I think the general
	direction will be on OS and Networking. 
	
	One important thing is that the interviewers generally
	dont ask you very high funda questions. They only
	want to test how well you did, whatever you claim to
	have done.
	
	It goes without saying that each of you must have
	one claim of of having done something.

> 8- Is there something like batches in which ygu have to join- Eg:

Even if the company has only a single interview the panel
will have a mix of both technical and HRD personnel. The 'Technical' 
part has been divided according to the topic of your interest. Here 
I would like to mention that, the courses you take during your MS 
matter a lot during the technical interview. The questions are mainly 
based on the courses you have done during the course of your MS and 
your area of interest. Its a wise choice to indicate area of interest
as a separate field if you are strong in a particular field and wish 
to draw the attention of the panel to your strong area. Lets begin the 
voyage in ernest. Before I begin, I request MS scholars to regularly
update the Jobs-QB for the benefit of the scolars to come.

    Sudhakar.

A) Technical
   ---------

OS:
--
Suggested readings: Modern Operating Systems; Tannenbaum (Must)
		    Design of Unix Operating Systems 	(Internals Fundaes)
		    The Magical Garden Unexplored 	(SVR4 internals)
		    Unix FAQ; available on internet

Questions every scholar should know:

i) Paging, segmentation fundaes. 
ii) Scheduling policy used by Unix.
	Should know how and why Unix assigns priorities to some processes.
iii) How and who handles a page-fault.
iv) Contents of an inode

Other Questions:

i) Unix buffer management.
ii) Unix Page-replacement policy
iii) Unix directory structure/files/Links (soft and hard link:difference)

Networks:
---------

Suggested Readings: Computer Networks; Tannebaum 
		    Unix Network Programming; Stevens
		    Networking with TCP/IP: Vol 1; Comer (A Good book)

Questions every scholar should know:

i) Seven layers of OSI stack, and a few functions of each layer. 
ii) The different modues of a TCP/IP stack and the functions of 
    each module.

Other Questions:

i)  Flow control, out of band data and how is it handled.
ii) How and who handles data looping (A packet is stuck in a loop)
iii)Structure of an IP Datagram header
iv) Structure of an ICMP header
v)  What is ARP and how does it find a physical address given an 
    internet address. Similarly for RARP
vi) Classes of internet addresses. Given an address you should be able
    to tell which class it belongs to. Fundaes on Sub-netting and 
    how will you assign addresses to the sub-networks.
vii) Some other stacks like the IPX/SPX and X.25 

Computer Architecture:
----------------------

Suggested readings:	Hwang and Briggs; 
			Hamacher

Questions every scholar should know:

i) Location of a cache in the storage heirarchy. 
ii) Cache access/replacement techniques. 
iii) Full-associative and set-associative caches. 

Other Questions:
---------------
i) TLB; look-aside-buffer
ii) SMP (Sequential Multiprocessor: Jani-Wipro Infotech asked)



C:
---

Suggested Readings:	Kernighan and Ritchie
			C-FAQ; internet

Questions every scholar should know:

i) Fundaes on Null pointers; what happens if you increment a null pointer.
ii) About bit-operators (Every interview will have questions where you 
   will have to operate on the bits; So remember or bit operators)
iii) Swapping 2 numbers without extra variables (Still the favourite?)
     Can you swap two floating numbers using the same technique?
iv) Swapping two nibbles of a byte; write a macro for that.
v) Counting all 1s in an integer.

Other Questions:
---------------

i) Variable parameters of a function. How is it implemented in C. 
   Give example of  functions which use varible parameters (printf etc).
ii) How are the fields in a printf accessed (from right to left) and why?
    Read the C-FAQ for such questions.
iii) Doubly linked lists. 


Data Structures:
----------------

i) B-Trees; B-Plus trees?


B) Personal
-----------

i) Tell us something about yourself. (This has to be there)
ii) Strengths and weaknesses (This question also disguised in various 
   forms is always asked).
iii) Why should we hire you?
iv) Can you describe your project in short?
v) Why did you take 2-1/2 years to complete (My case!)
vi) If given the job when can you join. (Caution: Don't think that if 
    you give some unreal early deadlines they will offer you the job.
    Always play safe and give a deadline by which time you are sure to 
    complete and join. Asking for extensions is the worst scenario). 

Tips: Be confident, frank (But need not give away information which may weigh
      against your case), free (use first names while addresing them, so be
      alert when they introduce themselves) and cheerful (attend an interview
      with a positive frame of mind). Remember you are IITians and you always
      have an edge. That may sound arrogant, but its true. 

Best of luck.
