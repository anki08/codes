I got this from one of the research scholars.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
One person from Uttar Pradesh (UP) was in Mysore forabout4 years and his wife was in Jaunpur (UP).  At the end of 4 years he distributed sweets to his colleages in office stating that his wife has delivered a Son.His colleagues were quite shocked and they asked how this happened when our friend was in Mysore and his wife in Jaunpur. He said it is common in UP that neighbours take care of the wife (good Samaritans) when he is at Mysore.

The colleagues asked him what name he would give to the son to which he
replied "If the second  neighbour from his house in Jaunpur is involved
then the name would be DWIVEDI, if it is the third neighbour then
it would be TRIVEDI, if it is the fourth neighbour then it would be
CHATURVEDI and if it is a mixture of all the three then it would be
named as MISHRA and if the wife feels shy to tell the name of the person involved then the name of the child would be SHARMA and if she refuses to divulge the name of the person involved then the name of the child would be GUPTA. If she does not remember then it is YADAV ,if she becomes Red faced on asking this then it is REDDY. If she is too enthusiastic about it then it is JOSHI.
