    If the paper rate increases at 1.5% more than the inflation rate which is 6.5% a year,
    then what wil be the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years?

(a) 29.12 
(b) 29.72

2. In A,B,C are having some marbles with each of them.
    A has given B and C the same number of marbles each of them already have.
    Then, B gave C and A the same number of marbles they already have.
    Then C gave A and B the same number of marbles they already have.
    At the end A,B,and C have equal number of marbles.

    Then the number of marbles B have at the end

(a) 2(x-y-z) 
(b) 4(x-y-z)
(c) 2(3y-x-z)
(d)  x + y-z

3. If a car starts from A towards B with some velocity.
    Due to some problem in the engine after travelling 30km, the car goes with 4/5 th of its actual velocity
