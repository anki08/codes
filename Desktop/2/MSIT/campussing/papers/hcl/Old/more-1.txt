This is a very good question bank for written test of some software companies.
This can be passed freely to anyone. No restrictions of Class, Branch,
Institute , bla bla ...

Optimize the below 1,2,3,4 questions for time:

1)
int i;
if i=0 then i:=1;
if i=1 then i:=0;

2)
int i;
if i=0 then i:=1;
if i=1 then i:=0;
(given that i can take only two values (1,0))

3)
int i;
if i=0 then i:=1;
else if i=1 then i:=0;
(given that i can take only two values (1,0))

4)
int m,j,i,n;
for i:=1 to n do
m:=m+j*n

5) Expand the following
 a) ISDN
 b) CASE
 c) CSMA/CD
 d) OOPS
 e) MIMD

6) In the following questions, answer A,B,C,D depending on when 
the errors are  detected?
  A if no error is detected
  B if semantic and syntactic checking
  C if during Code genration & Symbol allocation
  D run time

a) Array overbound
b) Undeclared identifier
c) stack underflow
d) Accessing an illegal memory location

7) How many page faults will occur for below sequence of pages when LRU
page replacement algorithm is used ( The memory can only have 3pages):

1,2,3,4,2,1,5,2,4 (something like that) 



8) If a CPU has 20 address lines but MMU does'nt use two of them.
   OS occupies 20K. No virtual memory is supported. What is the 
   maximum memory available for a user program?

9) For a binary tree with n nodes, How many nodes are there which
  has got both a parent and a child?

10) Understand the funda of incrementing a variable using 
    val++   and ++val . Some programs are given for error correction.

11) Learn datagram . (Computer networks)

12) Which of the following can be zero? (only one)
    a)  swap space
    b)  physical memory
    c)  virtual memory


13) What is a must for multitasking?
    a) Process preemption
    b) Paging
    c) Virtual memory
    d) None of the above

14) A question on call by value,
		  call by name,
		  call by reference.

f(x,y,z)
{
y := y+1;
z := z+x;
}
main()
{
int a,b;
a := 2
b := 2;
f(a+b,a,a);
print a;
}

what is the value of a printed for three different calls in main.

15) Using the following instructions and two registers , A&B.
   find out A XOR B and put the result in A
   PUSH <reg>
   POP  <reg>
   NOR    These instructions operates with A & B and puts the result in
   AND     A

(question basically to get XOR in terms of NOR and AND)

16) True/False questions:
   1) The page size should be the power of 2.
   2) 


 
17) 
int i=0;
int j=0;

loop: 
  if(i = 0)
     i++;
  i++;
  j++;
  if(j<= 25)
    goto loop
xxx:   


question1 : how many times is the loop entered 
A few questions of that sort. some count fundaes. Easy one )

18)  Who handles page faults? 
  a) OS
  b) MMU
  c) Hardware logic
  d) etc etc....

19)  For which of following is it not possible to write an algorithm.

a) To find out 1026th prime number
b) To write program for NP-complete problem
c) To write program which generates true Random numbers.
etc...

20) what is the essential requirement for an real-time systems
 
a) pre-emption
b) virtual memory
c) paging  etc...

Computer Architecture:
----------------------

Suggested readings:	Hwang and Briggs;Hamacher

Questions every scholar should know:

i) Location of a cache in the storage heirarchy. 
ii) Cache access/replacement techniques. 
iii) Full-associative and set-associative caches. 

Other Questions:
---------------
i) TLB; look-aside-buffer
ii) SMP (Sequential Multiprocessor: Jani-Wipro Infotech asked)



C:
---

Suggested Readings:	Kernighan and Ritchie;C-FAQ; internet

Questions every scholar should know:

i) Fundaes on Null pointers; what happens if you increment a null pointer
ii) ii) About bit-operators (Every interview will have questions where you 
   will have to operate on the bits; So remember or bit operators)
iii) Swapping 2 numbers without extra variables (Still the favourite?)
     Can you swap two floating numbers using the same technique?
iv) Swapping two nibbles of a byte; write a macro for that.
v) Counting all 1s in an integer.

Other Questions:
---------------

i) Variable parameters of a function. How is it implemented in C. 
   Give example of  functions which use varible parameters (printf etc).
ii) How are the fields in a printf accessed (from right to left) and why?
    Read the C-FAQ for such questions.
iii) Doubly linked lists. 


Data Structures:
----------------

i) B-Trees; B-Plus trees?


B) Personal
-----------

i) Tell us something about yourself. (This has to be there)
ii) Strengths and weaknesses (This question also disguised in various 
   forms is always asked).
iii) Why should we hire you?
iv) Can you describe your project in short?
v) Why did you take 2-1/2 years to complete (My case!)
vi) If given the job when can you join. (Caution: Don't think that if 
    you give some unreal early deadlines they will offer you the job.
    Always play safe and give a deadline by which time you are sure to 
    complete and join. Asking for extensions is the worst scenario). 

Tips: Be confident, frank (But need not give away information which may weigh
      against your case), free (use first names while addresing them, so be
      alert when they introduce themselves) and cheerful (attend an interview
      with a positive frame of mind). Remember you are IITians and you always
      have an edge. That may sound arrogant, but its true. 

Best of luck.
