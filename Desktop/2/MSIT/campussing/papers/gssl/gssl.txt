I am sending mainly c paper and some questions.Ra
also will send somethig.There are 15 c q's all are discriptive.

1)fallacy 
f()
{
int a;
void c;f2(&c,&a);
2)a=0;
b=(a=0)?2:3;
a) What will be the value of b? why
b) If in 1st stmt a=0 is replaced by -1, b=?
c) If in second stmt a=0 is replaced by -1, b=?
3)char *a[2]
int const *p;
int *const p;
struct new { int a;int b; *var[5] (struct new)
4)f()
{
int a=2;
f1(a++);
}
f1(int c)
{
printf("%d", c);
}
c=?
5)f1()
{
f(3);}
f(int t)
{
switch(t);
{
case 2: c=3;
case 3: c=4;
case 4: c=5;
case 5: c=6;
default: c=0;}
value of c?
6)Fallacy
int *f1()
{
int a=5;
return &a;
}
f()
int *b=f1()
int c=*b;
}
7)a)Function returning an int pointer
b)Function ptr returning an int ptr
c)Function ptr returning an array of integers
d)array of function ptr returning an array of integers
(See Scham series book)
8)fallacy 
int a;
short b;
b=a;
9)Define function ?Explain about arguments?
10)C passes  By value or By reference?
11)Post processed code for 
abc=1;
b=abc1; (1 or 2 blank lines are given)
strcpy(s,"abc");
z=abc;
12)difference between my-strcpy and strcpy ?check
13)f()
{
int *b;
*b=2;
}
14)Function which gives a pointer to a binary trees const an integer value
at each code, return function of all the nodes in binary tree.(Study)Check
15)Calling refernce draw the diagram of function stack illustrating the
variables in the -----then were pushed on the stack at the point when
function f2 has been introduced 
type def struct
{ double x,double y} point;
main( int argc, char *arg[3])
{double a;
int b,c;
f1(a,b);}
f1(double x, int y)
{
		Best of luck
