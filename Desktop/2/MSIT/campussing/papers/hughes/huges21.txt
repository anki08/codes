there are 20 questions all in techinical paper and 36 questions in appititude te
st

in appititude thay have given all diagrams and asked to find what comes next

thay are quite easy and i hope if u practice r.s aggraval u can do it easily

for tecnical thay have given 1 hr for 20 questions and for not technical thay ha
ve given only 40 min
and 36 questions

this is the paper i have right now

1. main()
   {
    fork();
fork();
fork();
printf("\n hello");
}

How many times print command is executed?

2.main()
{
 int i,*j;
  i=5;
j=&i;
printf("\ni= %d",i);
 f(j);

printf("\n i= %d",i);
}

void f(int*j)
{
int k=10;
  j= &k;
}  

output is
a 5 10
b 10 5
c 5 5
d none

3.
  some question on pipeline like you have to findout the total time 
by which execution is completed for a pipeline of 5 stages.

4.

  main()
{
   int *s = "\0";

   if(strcmp(s,NULL)== 0)
     printf("\n s is null")p
    else
     printf("\n s is not null");
}

5. 
  some syntax which returns a pointer to function

6.  size of integer is
    a. 2 bytes
    b 4 bytes
    c. machine dependant
    d compiler dependent.

7.max and avg. height of sorted binary tree

a. logn n
b n logn

8.
  some question. like the number was shifted everytime by one and bitwise and with 10000000.
  one was supposed to find what the code was doing.
  I feel the answer was most probably finding decimal value.

9. int a[5][4]

VSAT Overview

Why Use VSATs?

VSAT networks provide rapid, reliable satellite transmission of data, voice, and video to an unlimited number of geographically dispersed sites or from these sites to headquarters.

What Equipment Do I Need for My VSAT Network?

Each site is equipped with a VSAT terminal consisting of an antenna, outdoor electronics mounted on the antenna for signal reception/transmission, and indoor electronics for connection to customer computer, telephone, and video equipment.

Hughes Shared Hub Services Cost-effective real-time communications across town, or across the country.

Shared hub services from Hughes Network Systems: Making Satellite Technology work for your business.

Today, businesses in a wide variety of industries are relying on VSAT (very small aperture terminal) satellite networks to help them communicate with their remote locations no matter where they are across town, or across the country.

Even for businesses with relatively small numbers of remote sites, satellite networks can be one of the most cost-effective ways to obtain efficient, on-line communications.

The central the heart of your network.

VSAT networks rely on a central hub station to serve as the transfer point between the remote locations, the satellite, and company headquarters or data center. The hub contains the necessary uplink/downlink equipment to transmit signals to and from the satellite.

For many companies, it is not desirable or feasible to own and operate their own dedicated hub. The solution: shared hub services from Hughes.Shared Hub Services from Hughes give you the efficiency of on-line communications at a cost that agrees with your bottom line.

Hughes Network Systems owns and operates four full-service satellite hubs located across the country. The hubs operate seven days a week, 24 hours a day. For a reasonable monthly fee, you have all the advantages of on-line satellite communications:

Data transmission Real-time video Audio transmission Disaster recovery Pilot programs for new networks or applications

Using shared hub services means you avoid the expense of building your own hub and maintaining a technical staff to run it. You contract for only the amount of satellite bandwidth that you need on satellites built by the world's largest satellite manufacturer. And when your network needs to grow or change, you can count on Hughes to reconfigure the network quickly with a minimum of expense.

Disaster recovery: being ready for the unexpected.

No one likes to think that a disaster either natural or could hit the network. But in the event of a hub failure, whether it's a shared hub or a hub dedicated to one company's operation, Hughes is ready to put you back in business.

The Germantown hub provides complete backup service in the event of disaster. Hughes can bring your network back up rapidly and will keep it operating while hub repairs are underway. As soon as the hub is repaired, we switch you back to normal operation.

Let us show you how Hughes Shared Hub Services can help you advance the way your business communicates. Call 301-601-2610.
