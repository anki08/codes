but there were only 12-13 ques technical
baaki aptitude 
5-6 questions were on "people on some .... island say..that much truth
somebody says he belongs 2 this island then is he right and 
something......
aptitudes were easy but something different

technical were from basics of DBMS,operating s/s(mostly unix)and some 
programs of c & c++
actually what we have noticed is that in all the colleges the pattern 
is same but questions r different
in our college it was IBM GLOBAL,GURGOAN that visited 
in ur college it must be banglore branch so do ask ur neighbouring 
colleges better ask arpit (IIIT HYDERABAAD GUYS)all i remember is that he

common man? 
3. What are the steps in SDLC?
4. Which is the most important step in SDLC?
