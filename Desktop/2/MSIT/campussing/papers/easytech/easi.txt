			EASI-96
			=======

		NOW I AM SENDING EASI-TECH-96 PAPER
           FIRST PRIORITY FOR --F E M & C++
		You should prepare one FEM project work
	and mention it in your BIODATA as your present work.Then
	they will definitely call for interview even you perform
	worstly in written test.
	 One more thing is this year they have big FORD project.
	So priority is there for mechanicals.
		I WILL SEND REMAINING PAPERS BY POST.
			OOOOOKKKKKK!

	C QUESTIONS:WHAT IS THE OUT PUT FOR FOLLOWING PROGRAMMS
1)main()
{
char a[2];
*a[0]=7;
*a[1]=5;
printf("%d",&a[1]-a)
ANS:
   ans may be 1.(illegal initialization)
2)
#include<stdio.h>
main(){
char a[]="hellow";
char *b="hellow";
char c[5]="hellow";
printf("%s %s %s ",a,b,c);
printf(" ",sizeof(a),sizeof(b),sizeof(c));
}
(ans is     hellow,hellow,hellow
              6,2,5   )
3)
#include<stdio.h>
main()

float value=10.00;
printf("%g %0.2g %0.4g %f",value,value,value,value)
}
(ans is 10,10,10,10.000000)
4)
#include<stdio.h>
void function1;
int i-value=100;
main()
{
 i-value=50;
function1;
printf("i-value in the function=",i-value);
printf("i-value after the function=",i-value);
}
printf("i-value at the end of main=",i-value);
functioni()
i-value=25;


THIS IS ROUGH IDEA OF THE PROGRAM
   ANS ARE
1)i-value in the function=25;
2)i-value after the function=50;
3)i-value at the end of the main=100;

5)
  main()
{
funct(int n);
{
switch(n)
  case1:
        m=2;
  		break;
  case2:
	m=5;
		break;
  case3:
	m=7;
		break;
  default:
	m=0;
}
THIS IS ROUGH IDEA:
    (ANS:Out put is m=0)
