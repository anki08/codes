THIS PAPER HAS GIVEN IN IIT DELHI , SO GO THROUGH THIS IT WILL GIVE 
ROUGH IDEA;

1.   typedef struct{
	char *;
	nodeptr next;
	} * nodeptr;
what does nodeptr stand for?
2. supposing thaty each integer occupies 4 bytes and each charactrer 
1 byte , what is the output of the following programme?
#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
 int a[] ={ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
char c[] = {' a','x','h','o','k'};
printf("%d\t %d ", (&a[3]-&a[0]),(&c[3]-&c[0]));
}
ans : 3  3
3. what is the output of the program?
#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
struct s1 {int i; };
struct s2 {int i; };
struct s1 st1;
struct s2 st2;
st1.i =5;
st2 = st1;
printf(" %d " , st2.i);
}
ans: nothing  (error)
expl: diff struct variables should not assigned using "=" operator.


4.what is the output of the program?
#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
int i,j;
int mat[3][3] ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
for (i=2;i>=0;i--)
 for ( j=2;j>=0;j--)
printf("%d" , *(*(mat+j)+i));
}
ans : 9 6 3 8 5 2 7 4 1
5.
fun(n);
}
int fun( int n)
{
int i;
for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
fun(n-i);
printf(" well done");
}
 howmany times is the printf statement executed for n=10?

ans: zero
expl: Befire reaching to printf statement it will goes to infinite loop.

6.what is the output of the program?
main()
{
struct emp{
	char emp[];
	int empno;
	float sal;
};
struct emp member = { "TIGER"};
printf(" %d %f", member.empno,member.sal);

ans: error. In struct variable emp[], we have to give array size.
 If array size given
ans is 0, 0.00


7. output of the program?
	# define infiniteloop while(1)
	main()
	{
	infiniteloop;
	printf("DONE");
}
ans: none
expl: infiniteloop in main ends with ";" . so loop will not reach end;
and the DONE also will not print.
8.  output of the program?
	
main()
{
int a=2, b=3;
printf(" %d ", a+++b);
}
ans:5
expl: here it evaluates as a++ + b. 
9. output of the program?
#define prn(a) printf("%d",a)
#define print(a,b,c) prn(a), prn(b), prn(c)
#define max(a,b)  (a<b)? b:a
main()
{
int x=1, y=2;
print(max(x++,y),x,y);
print(max(x++,y),x,y);
}

ans: 3 4 2
10. which of the following is the correct declaration for the function main() ?
ans: main( int , char *[])
11. if ptr is defined as
	int *ptr[][100];
	which of the following correctly allocates memory for ptr?
ans: ptr = (int *)(malloc(100* sizeof(int));
FEW MORE PROGRAMS HERE BUT NOT AVAILABLE:
 

 

SECTION-A

you should write the programs for the following problems in C.

1. swapping two variables x,y without using a temporary variable.
2. a program has been given asking to find the output
ans. it is algorithm for finding G.C.D
3. write a program for reversing the given string.
4. the integers from 1 to n are stored in an array in a random
fashion. but one integer is missing. write a program to find the
missing integer.
ans. idea. the sum of n natural numbers is = n(n+1)/2.
if we subtract the above sum from the sum of all the
numbers in the array , the result is nothing but the
missing number.
5. some bit type of questions has been given on pointers asking to
to find whether it is correct from syntax point of view. and if
it is correct explain what it will do.(around 15 bits).

SECTION-B

ANSWER AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.

6.& 7. two programs on pre-processor directions has been given asking
to find the output.
8. simple question given on pointer
a) kernighan & richie page no. 122
b) schaum series page no. 323
try to understand the pointer problems given here he asked to 
explain
in the interview if answer it in exam.
9. write a c program to find whether a stack is progressing in forward
or reverse direction.
10. write a c program that reverses the linked list.

GUIDELINES:
the interview is very tough he is asking to do the problems in
front of him. he is also giving some new problems to solve before 
him.
you should have a very good funda of C language.
