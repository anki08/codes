14.Questions like
There are 4 sets of statements and each set with 3
statements .Identify the set
in which the first 2 sentences can be used to infer
the third
Eg:
1. All ATMs are in France.No PTMs are in France
No PTMs are ATMs
2. All ATMs are in France.No PTMs are in France
No ATMs are PTMs
You can see that in 1., if a PTM is an ATM,it should
be in FranceTherefore
1 is the answer

PAPER OF CSCI .
THERE R 75 Q’S .
NOW I AM SENDING ONLY ANS OF THIS Q’S.
TECHNICAL PAPER WAS VERY DIFFICULT.
U HAVE TO REMEMBER ALL THE ANS ,DON’T BOTHER ABOUT Q’S
,
THER R NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND ,SO MY ADVISE IS THAT
JUST REMEMBER THE 
ANS.
THE Q’S CAN REARRANG AT YOUR INSTITUTE WITH
DIFFERENT ORDER.
SO THESE R THE TECH PAPER WILL BE EXACTLY SAME IN ALL
COLLEGES.
THE ANS—
