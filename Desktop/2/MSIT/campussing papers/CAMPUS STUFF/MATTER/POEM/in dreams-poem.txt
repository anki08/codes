                           IN DREAM

Rememeber that day ?
when,lone you,amidst myraid
dreamt-sailed on a sojourn.
For the first time you saw the solacing sun of dawn,
then chirpy birds poured lucid notes in your ears
for the nonce you were lost.
So deep went the touch of feathery breeze,
you were drifted towards her silhouette against a diaphanous mist
you were all eyes
when her smile fled like butterflies
then feasted your perplexed eyes
thirsty for years
over those riotous colours of her
you could have felt the embrace of the welkin
 could have heard the whisper of the leaves
could have sensed the sonorous rumbling
of the ground beneath your feet
but you knelt-before her
and bowed
that deafening laughter could have you killed at once
you were petrified-your senses perished
you heard her voice - so rich -
"Respect was invented to fill up
 the empty place -
which belongs to love."
you couldn't utter a word
and where was she then
deja vu withered your heart
you dreamt for ever
