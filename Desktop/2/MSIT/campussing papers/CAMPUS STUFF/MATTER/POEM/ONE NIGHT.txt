		ONE NIGHT
Sitting by the candle light
Time passing by with every drop of rolling wax
Leaving a trace on its path
And  every drop coalescing unnoticed
Moments  dying into immortal past, with blue melting into aurerole flame
Remindsof life and oblivion events, faded to dusk
gatheroing and emerging,  like a bubble from deepest waters
desires accomplished and deeds  done


The battles fought and laurels won
The dreams come true ,  the dreams ruins
The exulting moments ,spirits in lowest ebb
The will that wins, the regret that quit
tThe lone walk, people around
Relations estranged and bonding bonds
All the nuances of life, waxing one on another
The flame  diminishing, extinguished in  mist of dew
A new day arrives, the time to fulfill awaiting promises
Before it glows ,in a new  candle  light.
