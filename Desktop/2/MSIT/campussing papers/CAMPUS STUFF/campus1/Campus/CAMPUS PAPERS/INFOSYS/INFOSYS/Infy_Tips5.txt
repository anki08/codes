Subject: [CHETANA] I got through INFOSYS


Hello everybody,
I have taken the INFOSYS test on 6th of july. 
Till date i didnt get any regret letter. So I rang up
to Infosys yesterday to hear the golden words from the
H.R  "U R SHORTLISTED". They informed me that
they'll send the furthur details (like place & date of
posting) regarding this in a week or two. 

Comming to the procedure of getting into Infosys,
The details given in this group abt the test helped me 
a lot in getting here. 

And also my heartfull thanks to everyone who have posted 
useful info to the grp.

If anyone is taking the infy test in the future,
dont worry. What i believe is , its only tough to get
a call letter from Infosys for the test, because it is
only a matter of luck . Once u get a call letter, u
can easily get through the test provided u work upon a
few books . 

The books which i suggest are,

1. Shakuntala Devi puzzles
2. Shakuntala Devi more puzzles 
3. George Summers
4. Brain Teasers-  by Ravi Narula
5. G.R.E . Barrons (few analytical questions)

This is something for infosys aspirants. other than
the 4 books ( shakuntala devi 1&2, george summers,
barrons GRE ) infosys test paper makers are
considering one more book. 

its BRAIN TEASERS by RAVI NARULA. 

a couple of questions from the july 6th infy
test are direct questions from this book. so along
with the 4 books u better prepare from this book also.


Its not that all the questions come directly from
these books, but u get acquainted to the type of
questions appearing in the test and ur brain will get
tuned to them.  There is every chance of a couple of
questions surfacing from these books too. And also
dont forget to refer to the previous papers. U can
find them in the groups home page( in the files). 
On the test day what i suggest is, donot panic . keep
a cool mind . This is most important because that 1 hr
matters a lot . Usually u get 9 to 11 questions. among
them around 4 questions  are very easy. anyone can
answer them. some 2 to 3 questions will be very tough
ones. better not to go for them. if u start answering
them, they'll take half of ur time and in the end u
may not get the correct answer. So ur expertise lies
in finding such questions. The remaining 3 to 4
questions are average kinda questions. and those r the
deciding questions. u should be very careful answering
them, just to make sure that u did not make any silly
mistakes( like wrong calculations).  Once u complete
this paper( after 1 hr) , u have to take 
a english test. Its very easy and u need not worry abt
this. This section lasts for 30 minutes.
Thats all about the test, and if have any queries u
can mail me.

So...Good luck ,

Regards,
Chaitanya kumar.v
