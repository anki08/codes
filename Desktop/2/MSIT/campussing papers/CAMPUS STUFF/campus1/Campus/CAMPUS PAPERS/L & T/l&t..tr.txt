10. One question in which o/p voltage of the opamp goes to saturation.

11. what is the component that is needed to save the transistor from 
high currents?

13.slew rate 2v/us, then what is maximum gain for  change in .5v in 10us.
ans. 40

14.DAC. max 10v, 10bits, find resolution.
ans.   10mv
15.the i/p to black box is square wave and its o/p is impulse. what 
is the bl ack box. (ans. high pass filter)
16 the technique used by doordarshan
17 frequency used by doordarshan
18 in changing  sample -rate which  will change
a. quantise error ,b c d
19. error due to ad conversion ans -0.1%
20. which have higher bandwidth - ans optical fibre
21 what is reason for higher bandwidh of optical fibre..
22.which controller is used for type-0 system ans.- p controller
23   ina circuit supply voltage is v , and two capacitor  1 uf, 2uf in series, 
which have  charges more
a. c1, b c2, c same d. don't say
ans. same
24. why darlington pair is used ?
high current gain..
25. one question on pulse amplitude modulation
26 op-amp circuit  - act as .. ans- unity follower
   with Rf=0.
27.which key is used in 8085 for slower devices
ans. rdy
28 memory size of 8085
and 64Kb
29. which rating of voltmeter willbe used 
( some rating given as v/i, i/v ...)

rest is out of memory.....
   


S-II. general comprehension(36 questions, time 40min)

in this test u have to complete the next figure in the series

S-III. mechanical comprehension(60 questions, time 40min).

question based on gear-wheel arrangement(around 10), pulley-tension, moment of 
force, and wind velocity,

interview:

1. working if ammeter (moving coil galvanometer)
2. shunt in an ammeter (derivation & explanation)
3. Ammeter internal resistance-range.
4. some easy programs in up8085 for ddebugging 
5. optimised code for cal ling four sub-routines depending on the 
value of accumulator 
(use PCHL)

ans:
Eg:
        Mvi a, data
Mvi l,00
mov h,a
pchl
hlt

A=01 jumps to 100
A=02 jumps to 200
......
6. draw the ckt. for the unity gain non-inverting amplifier.
7. then draw the same ckt. for the 0.1 gain.
(ans: use the potential divider at the input.)
8. find out the er ror in the ADC characteristics.
many questions in AtoD and DtoA convertors.

9.   
mvi a,00h
     jz loop1
     mvi a,12h
sta yyyy
hlt
loop1:  mvi a,66h,
sta yyyy
hlt

what is the output of the above program
ans:error
we have to add a statement(ie. XRA a for the JZ to work) before mvi 
a,00h.

10.what is an instrumentation amplifier?
11.why do we need it.
12.diff. between floating gnd. and referenced gnd.
13. what is relation between  accuracy and resolution






 the technical part for ece -ice   are same but for electrical  it is completely based on electric machine and 

power electronics... and in interviews too...

 so prepare for that... i   have no question for that...
