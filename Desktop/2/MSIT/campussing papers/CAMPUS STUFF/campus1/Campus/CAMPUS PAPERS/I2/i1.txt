
                         I2:

     This paper mainly consists of two parts,one hour each. First
part consists of mainly reasoning q's and artificial inteligence
q's. Second paper consists ofprogramming skills, includes some tough
q's( CS standard) and other q's are related to 'C' .

Here I am giving  some Q's.

Part .1

time - 1 hr.

 Here in  the reasonig q's they have given some pasages and asked
find best assumptions, asked find better conclusion drawn from the
passage. They are all multiple chice q's. This paper is relatively
easy. But you have to read and understand q's as quickl
y as possible . Time is sufficient.

part - 2.

 time- 1 hr

sec-1 : 20 q's  60 marks    ( one  -ve mark for the wrong ans).

1. convert 0.9375 in to binary form. ( prepare these conversoin well).

2.parameters are passed to functions only by value (y/n).

3.if a&b are int arrays then the expression a==b  can never evaluate to true.(y
/n).

4. The expression (a+b)*c*d)-e is represented as an exp.tree. the
tree is threaded for inorder to traversal left to right. What does
the right child pointer of 'd' point to
  a. -node  b. null c.*node  d. +node          ans: may be B.

5.   #include< stdio.h>
      void swap(int *, int *);
      main()
2      {
        int arr[8]= { 36,8,97,0,161,164,3,9};
        for(int i=0; i < 7; i++)
          for(int j=i+1; j<8; j++)
          if (arr[i]<arr[j]) swap (&arr[i],&arr[j]);
        }

        viod swap (int *x , int *y){
        
         int tmp;
         static int cnt=0;
         tmp=*x; *x=*y; *y=tmp;
         cnt++;
         }


  What is the value of cnt after end of the programe.

  asn : 15 (chek it).

6. int foo(int a, int b){
    if(a&b) return 1;
    return 0;
    }
2
  a) a or b =0, ret - 0   b) a&b != 0 , ret 1  c)a&b = -ve , ret 1 d)a&b of dif
f signs ,ret 0.

7. main()
   {
    FILE *fp;
    fp= fopen ("test.dat","w");
    fprintf(fp,"Hello");
    fclose (fp);
    fp= fopen("test.dat", "w");
    fprintf(fp,"world");
    fclose(fp);
    return 0;

   Assuming that the file test.dat existing already, What is the
size of the file at the end of the programme.

8.  #include<stdio.h>
    int f1(int *x, int flag)
    {
      int *y;
      y=(int *)malloc(size of(int));
      *y= *x +3;

      swith(flag){
      case 0: break;
      case 1:*x=*y ; break;
      case 2: x=y; break;
2      }
      return;
      }
      main(){
      int *x,*y,*z;
      int i,j,k;
      x=(int *)malloc(size of(int));
      *x=5;
      i=f1(x,0); j=f1(x,1);
      printf("%d %d %d ",i.j,*x);
      }

    ans:888


9. the function ttt is ment to swap orguments. what change is needed
to it in the folloing programe.

   void ttt(int a,int b){
   int t; t=a;a=b;b=t;
   --------
   -------

   asn: change a and b to *a and *b through out.


section - 2

time-20 min         20 marks.

here only one q's is asked that is to write a programe for the following
problemin C++, if you know. otherwise you can write in C also.


1. A school management is having two schools. but they wanted to
club the two schools to a new big school such that the students standard
and division is not changed( for ex the std of 7f i.e 7 standard
and f division remain on 7f in the new school also).
 given the information like different standards asd divisions and
their respective strengths of each school is having and that is terminated by $
 symbol.

1A 30,1B 25,2A 20,2B 45,2C 30,.....$1A 15,1B 20,1C 20,1D 30,2A 35,2B 25,3A 20..
.....$


read information and print the out put  as above, of the new school.and
print the total strength of that also.

   constraints given:






          Dont use the limit for the classes( i.e we dont need to
use the array so here use linked lists and define a structure for
class name and strength. try it in this approach.)

Regarding interview
            HE is asking personal, languages like c, c++, java etc and other ge
neral q's.
