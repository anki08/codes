   There are two cateagiries : Technologies and Application
   For Technologies there are four sections :
   a) Computer awareness  (15) b) C programs          (20)
   c) Analysis of Program (10) d) Analytical Problems (20)

   For Application All questions are Analytical only (Verbal & Q.A)
   Pre-requisite  : Sound knowledge in C and little of C++
   For Interviews : C,C++,Networking(layers,TCP/IP,SPX/IPX) & Data Structure
        in both Application and Technoligies division.  Also they are asking
        questions from the question paper(technoligies) in which the
        candidate had commited mistakes or left out

   Note : Refer Programming in ANSI C by Kernignan & Ritche : some c question
          where taken from it.  Also when asked about which book you are
          following, don't say Let Us C by Kanitkar, atleast say some really
          good books like Prog. in ANSI C, Sprit of C etc;

SECTION III - ANALYSIS PROGRAM SEGMENTS
---------------------------------------

1) Here is the structure declaration of a doubly linked list

struct dlink {
int nodeid;
struct dlink *next;
struct dlink *prev;
} dlink_t;

A pointer of the head of the linked list is maintained as a global variable,
whose definition is 
dlink_t *head;

The funtion remove_element(dlink_t *rp), needs to remove the node pointed to
the rp and adjust the head.

The first node's prev and the last node's next are NULL.

remove_element(dlink_t *rp)
{
rp->prev->next = rp->next;
rp->next->prev = rp->prev;
if( head == rp)
head = rp->next;

Which of the following statement is true about the fution remove_element

A) It work when head is the same as rp
B) It does not work when rp is the last element on the list
c) It sets the head of the list correctly

Answer :B) It does...

2) Consider the following function written in c:

char *
index(sp,c)
register char *sp,c;
{
do {
if(*sp == c)
return (sp);
} while (*sp++);
return NULL;
}

The first argument sp, is a pointer to a C string. The second
argument, c, is a character. This function scarches for the character
c, in the string. If it is found a pointer to that location is returned
else NULL is returned.
This function works
a) Always
b) Always, but fails when the first byte contais the character c
c) works when c is a non NULL character only
d) Works only when the character c is found in the string
