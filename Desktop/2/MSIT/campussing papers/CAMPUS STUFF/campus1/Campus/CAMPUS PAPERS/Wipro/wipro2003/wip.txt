                       Regarding the interview,there will be a 
compulsory HR and Technical interview(in any order) for all the 
short listed candidates.Be strong in your 'C' programming 
skills.Also,make sure that you take with you your project reports(if 
you have done any).This might be useful to impress the 
interviewers.Then be strong in Operating Systems,if you had that in 
your academics.Do not ever say that,"I will be able to write down 
the logic,but not the program".Two of my friends told this and they 
were not selected.be confident and clear cut,..
                        Be careful while filling in the resume given 
by them.The columns in the resume are,for example

1.Where do you think you have to improve yourself?

3.Your strengths and weaknesses.
                        HR questions will be from your resume.

INTERVIEW DURATION WILL BE MINIMUM 1 HOUR(HR + TECHNICAL) for each 
person.
                        Also,in my department only those who have
