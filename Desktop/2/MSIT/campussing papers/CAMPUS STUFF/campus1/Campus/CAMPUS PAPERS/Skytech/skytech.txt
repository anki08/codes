
dear rajesh,
 
dont be frightened about the interview --- i have attended the skytech interview previously this year --- they had asked a few questions of which i remember a few as -
 
in C++
regarding inheritance ( most probably multiple inheritance)
 
in SQL
how to select 5 rows out of 200 rows returned by a select statement
something regarding use of distinct in select statement
 
HR
locational preference
would you copy a job work previously done by someone if needed
your area of liking(programming,mainframe etc)
 
well the persons conducting the interview were pretty cool and they never disturbed me in any way --- be confident and give stress on C,C++,SQL etc
 
all the best --- fyi i didnot get chance there.
