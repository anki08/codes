Ans: can be found out by multiplying the constants and the first term 
i.e. (3nX5m)2i.e. work backwards from the answers. This was the first 
question in our paper

31.  A watch at every hour strikes the pendulum and in this it looses 
one minute, i.e it looses one minute at 12 o clock, 1.o clock, and so 
onK If the clock starts exactly at 12:00 then what time will it be when 
the clock shows 1:30 next day. 
       ANS : questin was very easy, just find the no. of hours (say x)  
between the two given times and then add that minutes equal to [x] to 
the time shown by the clock and u will get the answer.

32.  sqrt(6+„Ï(6+„Ï(6+¡K¡K=Y, where „Ï means square root.FIND Y.

not just on 6.This was 2nd or 3rd question of our paper.

33. Two cars Ferrari and masserati are heading towards each other on a 
crash track with speeds 50kmph and 40 kmph respectively. Both the cars 
started when they were 90 km apart. As soon as the cars starts moving 
towards each other, a bee sitting on the hood of the Ferrari , starts to 
move towards the messarati with a speed of 100kmph, and after touching 
it it flies back towards Ferrari and so on, till they collideK Find the 
total distance traveled by the bee.
Ans. 100 km. The answer can be obtained by finding the total time taken 
to crash, and then multiplying it by the speed of the bee.

34.There was one question on the decelaration of a car, I don't 
remember the statics, 
              BUT ANS : the answer was probably V3.***. There will be 4 
options given 1.***, 3.***, -1.***,-3.***. So it will be easy for you 
to identify the answer as there will be only one answer with V3.***. 
Also you can work with the formula v2 ¡V 	u2 = 2as.
 35.    It was given that on a  Kya Kya island  there are only two kind 
of people. One type asked questions whose answer was always yes. While 
the other asked question whose answer was always no. now there were 
around 5 questions given on this info.. they were pretty easy. Just use 
your logic. I don't remember all the question. But just for example,
I can give you a question:
U are a visitor  on the island and one person asks you ¡§Am I of the no 
type?¡¨ now think which type the person is? No , yes or it cannot be 
determined from the question meaning the question is illogical. All the 
question could be worked out with such simple logic.
