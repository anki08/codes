There are two parts :
Note: The Answers given here are what i wrote, May not be correct.

1. Aptitute test : 15 Minutes, 20 Questions

Towards the middle questions are easy than from the front.

eg. Product of three consecutive nos. 210. What is the sum
of two least numbers?
ans.: 5 * 6 * 7 = 210 , sum = 11 is answer

eg. If the area of the sqaure is increased by 69 % how
much the length of the side will increase?

ans.: 13 (i think)
eg. if the sum of five consecutive nos. 35? how many prime 
nos
are there :

ans: 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 35 so two primes

eg. if the length of the rectangle is reduced by 20% and 
breath
is increased by 20 % what is the net change ?
ans.: 4 % decrease

2. 


i. Electrical & Electronics : 15 Questions
and,nand...circuit realted stuff, ..........

ii.Data Structures, Algo., & Complexity theory : 5 questions

a. if W is a sequence of strings without a and W' is its reversal
then WaW' is generated by:

ans. i think Context Free Grammmars

b. Whether all recusive pgm can be writtten iteratively?

c. What data structes you will use if you want to go to first record 
from
the last and vice versa? 
ans.: doubly linked circular list

d. Given 10000 nos. and 48MB Memory. What is the complexity of the 
efficient sorting algo.? (the algo. is not mentioned)

e. Given a C code and ask what it does?
I think the code was something similar to Bubble sort and that
particular code does the sorting in Desending order and the complexity
is O(n^2)(which is the next question).

iii. OS : 5 questions

a. If there are too many page faults what is the problem?

b. To ensure one pgm. doesnt corrupt other pgm. in a Multi-pgm. 
enviornment
what you should do?

d. Which one is not needed for Multi-pgm. enviornment?
options are: virtual memory,security,time sharing,none of the
above. 


iv. Networks and Hardware: 5 questions

a. Which one is not done by Data link layer ?
