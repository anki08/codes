hi,
   The questions asked were from the following
sections:
1)numerical :
          profit & loss, percentages, mixtures,
time and distance, time and work.
2)analytical :
          venn diagrams ( if in a class of 40
students, 10 speak only telegu, 20 speak both telegu
and tamil....), probability, drawing conclusions...
3) verbal : was basically easy -- just synonyms,
choose the correct one.., passage.

                         the test was easy. there were
60 questions( 60 mins). Can anyone of you tell me what
are we expected to study for the interview.
                                  madhuri.
